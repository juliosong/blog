Every now and then I can't help wondering: Is my subject useless? Don't get me wrong. Linguistics is interesting, big-time. From its sounds to its structures to its implicatures, every facet of human language fascinates me endlessly. However, ``the wonders of language''---to quote the title of a recent [book](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Wonders_of_Language.html?id=Ip_cDQAAQBAJ) by my doctoral advisor (and that of a [radio series](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p029486v) on BBC)---seem so difficult to be gotten across that despite the continuous efforts of linguisticians, when it comes to linguistics all that comes to the public's minds is little more than a fleeting moment of ineffable awe (that is, in the best scenario). Few have the time to stop and ponder about something so natural in and inalienable from the human life. 

You can call me a pessimist, but you can't deny the frustration many of us (linguisticians) have had when trying (and failing) to explain to friends and relatives outside academia what we do in our day-to-day research and why that matters---or to convince funding bodies why they should  invest in a linguistics project instead of a physics or engineering one. The latter seems more profitable in almost every conceivable way.
