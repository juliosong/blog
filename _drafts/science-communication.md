Communication is at the heart of many of the biggest challenges facing scientists today. Being able to articulate your work to a broad audience can have a tremendous impact on the discoverability of your research and the trajectory of your career. ‚ÄúCan you explain this topic to your mom? Your senator? If so, you have an automatic boost to your research,‚Äù says Cynthia Burrows, Editor-in-Chief of Accounts of Chemical Research.

Instead, scientists need to demonstrate their competency, but also show warmth. Scientists are often ranked highly for the first trait, but not the second, which can limit their ability to influence others. Whether talking to reporters or to the general public, scientists must be aware of their audience‚Äôs perspective. Scientists tend to have specialized knowledge and a rigorous focus on research details that their audience most likely does not share. They must find ways to bridge the gap between those worldviews.

This requires finding a balance between explaining research in an accessible way and running the risk of sensationalizing or otherwise distorting research. It also requires not resorting to a paternalistic attitude. Many of the best practices of science communication are easy to understand. Avoid jargon. Talk about why a finding matters, rather than the methodology used. Put research in context. But the application of these ideas is nuanced and can only be mastered with practice. Which terms count as jargon? The answer may well depend on the audience.

By engaging a variety of different audiences on a regular basis, scientists can learn to calibrate their explanations. Not only should scientists seek out venues for informal science communication, they should evaluate their performance so that they can refine their approaches. Science communication, much like scientific research, may require much trial and error before a breakthrough is made.

https://eos.org/opinions/the-unexpected-benefits-of-science-communication-training:
When scientists learn better communication skills, they not only convey their research to a broader audience but also become better connected to their own scientific communities.

effective science communication to a nonexpert audience is often anathema to the way students and early-career researchers are trained to communicate with other scientists in terms of the level of detail, jargon, and communication structure.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_communication):
Science communication is the practice of informing, educating, sharing wonderment, and raising awareness of science-related topics. 

Two types of defined science communication are science outreach (typically conducted by professional scientists to non-expert audiences) and science "inreach" (expert to expert communication from similar or different scientific backgrounds).

[Wikipedia#Scientific literacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_literacy):
The OECD PISA Framework (2015) defines scientific literacy as "the ability to engage with science-related issues, and with the ideas of science, as a reflective citizen."

According to the United States National Center for Education Statistics, "scientific literacy is the knowledge and understanding of scientific concepts and processes required for personal decision making, participation in civic and cultural affairs, and economic productivity".

http://blogs.nature.com/naturejobs/2017/02/10/science-communication-what-it-takes/ :
Communicating about science is a noble profession, and one that‚Äôs becoming increasingly and ever more popular.

In most cases you won‚Äôt necessarily be surrounded by people who intrinsically understand and support what you‚Äôre doing ‚Äî you will have to convince them of your value. Researchers have to reach the broader public with their research. If they want public funding for research to increase, they need to start investing in outreach.

https://www.aaas.org/resources/communication-toolkit :
The way scientists are trained is excellent preparation for communicating with precision about your work with colleagues. When communicating with public audiences, however, you need to shift to the way you would speak when ‚Äòoff the clock.‚Äô Think about the last time you explained your work to a friend or family member. Those who care about you are highly motivated to understand the science you work on, yet they may struggle to engage with it.

cf. Baron 2010 Escape from the Ivory Tower

In a crowded communication environment, most people don‚Äôt need to read or listen to content that is not immediately compelling to them. To capture their attention, start with the bottom line in a way that is relevant to the audience and then share more details. Being proactive about the way you phrase your key ideas to speak directly to an audience‚Äôs interests, or even embedding a discussion of science in places where less motivated audiences might discover them accidentally, will help you more deeply engage with that audience, which will likely increase the odds of achieving your engagement goal. You should also consider tactics like removing jargon, and weighing the need for precise language with what is most relevant to your audience and will engage them.

[What's this science communication and public engagement stuff all about?](https://thebraindomain.org/2017/10/10/whats-this-science-communication-and-public-engagement-stuff-all-about/):
The National Coordinating Centre for Public Engagement‚Äôs (NCCPE) definition is useful:
>> Public engagement describes the myriad of ways in which the activity and benefits of higher education and research can be shared with the public. Engagement is by definition a two-way process, involving interaction and listening, with the goal of generating mutual benefit.

Two key points: (1) the two way exchange, (2) mutual benefit.

üí°[Effective communication, better science](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/effective-communication-better-science/):

Science communication is part of a scientist's everyday life. Scientists must give talks, write papers and proposals, communicate with a variety of audiences, and educate others.

I am defining science communication broadly, meaning any activity that involves one person transmitting science-related information to another, from peer-reviewed articles to tweets.

Effective communication means transmitting your message clearly and concisely so that it is understood. It‚Äôs about engaging your audience ‚Äì it‚Äôs about the ‚ÄòSo what?‚Äô and ‚ÄòWhy does it matter?‚Äô of your message.

When scientists are able to communicate effectively beyond their peers to broader, non-scientist audiences, it builds support for science, promotes understanding of its wider relevance to society, and encourages more informed decision-making at all levels, from government to communities to individuals. It can also make science accessible to audiences that traditionally have been excluded from the process of science. It can help make science more diverse and inclusive.

Public communication encourages scientists to think about the big picture. For instance, scientists can get bogged down with the specifics of a research question or use too much jargon to explain a concept. Public communication encourages scientists to find simple, more succinct ways to get the essentials of their message across. Why does/should it matter to your audience? Why is it important?

‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt explain it simply, you don‚Äôt understand it well enough,‚Äù Albert Einstein said. As experts, scientists have a deep knowledge of particular subjects. To communicate something effectively, one needs a similarly deep knowledge of the associated skills. Public communication offers scientists ways to learn and practice the basics of effective communication.

üí°[Effective communication](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/effective-communication-13950970/) -- part of the book English Communication for Scientists

Effective communication is about getting your message across. Specifically, it involves capturing your audience's attention, ensuring your audience understands the idea you are trying to convey, and encouraging your audience to do something with that information, such as remember it, apply it, or provide feedback.

A message is not just information; rather, it is the interpretation of the information. If information is the answer to the question What? (as in "What did you find in your research?"), then the message is the answer to the question So what? (as in "What do your findings mean to your audience?"). 

Effective communication, therefore, is centered on the audience: It is audience-friendly, just as effective software is user-friendly.

- Taking the medium into account
In oral presentations, you convince an audience by selecting cogent arguments, by articulating them logically, and, especially, by delivering them effectively.

- Showing respect for your audience
Respect is about how you say things (your tone) more than about what you say. In general, dare to say things the way they are. 

Given that your intent when communicating about science is to make the audience understand, make it a habit to write and speak in a simple, straightforward way. 
Instead of striving to imitate the intricate style of many papers, explain things as simply as you would to a colleague, face to face.

[Successful science communication: A case study](https://arstechnica.com/science/2010/06/successful-science-communication-a-case-study/):
It is no secret that, in general, i.e. outside of dedicated science reporting venues and the occasional medical report on the evening news, the scientific community does a craptastic job of communicating with the general public.

"More effective communication is badly needed at almost every level of science," said Kirsten Grorud-Colvert, a research associate in the Department of Zoology at Oregon State University. "It doesn't have to be expensive, but we have to get out of the ivory tower, away from our scientific jargon and work more closely with our various audiences."

- know your audience
- identify a few main messages
- one size/strategy/vector does not fit all
- learn from your experience

[Science Communication for All](https://www.asm.org/Articles/2018/March/Teaching-Microbiology):
Participating in outreach work helps me appreciate the difficulties in speaking to a wide variety of audiences. It also constantly reminds me of the importance of accurate dissemination of scientific information, and how hard it can be to explain scientific concepts without relying on technical jargon!

[Five principles of science communication](https://www.socialsciencespace.com/2018/04/five-principles-of-science-communication/):
Science is like any other good or service‚Äîit must be strategically marketed (or communicated) if we want members of the public to accept, use, or support it in their daily lives.

- tell a story: Great science and great stories have something in common---as [Frank Sesno](https://gwtoday.gwu.edu/good-storytelling-moves-planet-forward) explained, both involve ‚ÄúCompelling characters overcoming obstacles to achieve a worthy outcome.‚Äù | There is a move towards [‚Äútweetable‚Äù research](https://twitter.com/hashtag/MyOneScienceTweet?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2017%2F10%2F31%2F16582162%2Fone-thing-scientists-want-you-to-know-twitter-hashtag-science-facts), or attention-grabbing, tweet-sized science.

- make the message personall: Clearly articulate why people should care about your science. This involves thinking about what matters to the audience and then framing your message in a way that makes it more localized. | The identity and public perception of the messenger matters. As communicators, we must consider how our own identities might impact the way our message is received. 

- communicate _with_ people rather than _to_ them: Effective science communicators should aim to create a moments that enthuse people to keep learning about our science and asking questions, even after we are gone.

- remember to be a human first: If we want people to understand and use our science in their lives, we must earn their trust. | scientists should realize that they are not objective actors, there is no such thing as unbiased science, and some science is inherently and unavoidably political in today‚Äôs climate. When communicating science, we must acknowledge our own biases and maintain honest and transparent communication with our audience. | Ahna Skop encouraged us to use art to make science more accessible and to ‚Äúalways have a hobby in science‚Äù so we can engage people with something we love and they know. 

[English Communication for Scientists](https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/contents/)
**Unit 1 Communicating as a Scientist**
scientists are increasingly considered to be accountable to society at large; hence, you must know how to communicate successfully with people from a variety of backgrounds.

This Nature Education series on English Communication for Scientists aims to help you communicate more effectively as a scientist, specifically in the English language.

Readers and listeners vary in how much they know about the topic you discuss and about your broader scientific field. Specialists will likely want more detail. They can apply detailed information in their own work, or they might need it to be convinced of the validity of your conclusions. Nonspecialists, on the other hand, need more basic information, especially in the introduction. Nonspecialists also require more interpretation, typically with the conclusions. They also need simpler vocabulary (or definitions), as they have not mastered the technical terms of your field.

As a scientist, you may find it challenging to present your work ‚Äî or to explain scientific concepts in general ‚Äî to a less specialized audience. More challenging still, however, is addressing a mixed audience of both specialists and nonspecialists. Whether you are addressing specialized or less specialized audience members, it is a good idea to convey early the motivation for the work you report so that they can relate to it ‚Äî that is, you must bridge the gap between what they know or are interested in and what you will present. With nonspecialists, this gap is wider than with specialists. You might find it harder to convey the motivation for your work. 

One type of comparison that is useful to all audiences but particularly to less specialized ones, including students, is the analogy. When you draw a parallel between a new concept you are trying to explain and one that is familiar to (or easily grasped by) the audience, you increase the probability that your audience will understand the concept and remember it.

Visual material ‚Äî appropriate for all audiences but crucial for nonspecialists ‚Äî can include drawings and photographs. 

be audience-friendly ‚Äî that is, identify what the audience needs or wants to learn.

[Citizen science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science):
Citizen science is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur (or nonprofessional) scientists. The currently most popular citizen science websites are [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org), [eBird](https://ebird.org/home), and [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org). The terms citizen science and citizen scientists entered the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) in June 2014..

Citizen science may be performed by individuals, teams, or networks of volunteers. Citizen scientists often partner with professional scientists to achieve common goals. Large volunteer networks often allow scientists to accomplish tasks that would be too expensive or time consuming to accomplish through other means.

[Elevator speech](http://sfp.ucdavis.edu/files/163926.pdf):
An elevator speech is a clear, brief message or ‚Äúcommercial‚Äù about you. The idea behind having an elevator speech is that you are prepared to share this information with anyone, at anytime, even in an elevator.

[Killikelly 2018 Using the tools of informal science education to connect science and the public](https://www.asmscience.org/content/journal/jmbe/10.1128/jmbe.v19i1.1427):
Traditional modes of communication within the scientific community, including presentation of data at conferences and in peer-reviewed publications, use technical jargon that limits public engagement. Here, I present three tools to create connections between the public and science: 3 - D objects, games, and storytelling. These multidimensional and multisensory methods do more than promote understanding of scientific data; they may also be used to convey science as a verb and as an essential viewpoint in the human struggle for understanding. 

Many scientists subscribe to the _information-deficit model_: if only the public understood x they would get y. However, this approach rarely works and often backfires, causing those presented with the information to hold more tightly to their opposing beliefs. 

[Baron 2010 Escape from the ivory tower](https://books.google.com/books/about/Escape_from_the_Ivory_Tower.html?id=bJXGoQxaijsC&source=kp_book_description):

p3 It is time for the very best scientists to engage. Yet there is a dearth of scientists who can deliver their information effectively and are willing to speak out.

p5 If you decide you want to inform those outside your research arena and help guide public discourse, you will need to learn a new set of skills.These include knowing exactly what you want to say, understanding your audience, and using common language to get your main points across clearly.

p8 Scientists often assume that people will naturally understand why their sci- ence is important. But more often than not, they don‚Äôt.The person who you are talking to (or perhaps at) is wondering,‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this?‚Äù When the answer is not forthcoming, people soon cease to listen or care. Watch them closely and you can see when their eyes begin to glaze over.

p11 The saddest aspect of life today is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom. -- Isaac Asimov

p13 there are multiple reasons to learn how to translate your work for broader audiences. It can alert the public and policymakers to issues of importance.

p14 ‚ÄúBeing able to communicate with nonscientific audiences greatly improves one‚Äôs ability to communicate with scientific audiences as well‚Äîwe are all human after all,‚Äù says Ben Halpern of the University of California at Santa Barbara.‚ÄúLearning to communicate is a critical life skill but it is not generally encouraged or taught within academic halls of science.‚Äù

p17 ‚ÄúScience and democracy have always been twins,‚Äù writes Dennis Overbye in the New York Times, stating a widely held view among journalists (Overbye 2009).This is why reporters get frustrated when they encounter scientists who are reluctant to come forward.They believe that scientists have an ethi- cal obligation to share their expertise and engage in debates about everything from human medicine to structural integrity of buildings to the preservation of rare and endangered species. 

p19‚Äì20 Pielke 2007 in his book _The Honest Broker: Making Sense of Science in Policy and Politics_ argues that scientists have a choice in how they engage with politics and society, and identifies four idealized roles: the pure scientist, the science arbiter, the honest broker of policy alternatives, and the issue advocate. If scientists want to maximize their ability to inform the views of decision makers, the honest broker's approach is usually most effective when high-stakes, value-laden debates are at play. It is particularly important for scientists to recognize and avoid claiming objectivity while using scientific authority as a tool to advance an agenda.

p20 ‚ÄúHow can you enter the murky worlds of popularization, advocacy, and po- litical negotiations‚Äîall of which are essential to get action . . . while at the same time preserving the soundness of the science?‚Äù -- the key is to clearly distinguish when you are talking about your science and when you are speaking as a citizen.

p21 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs up to us, as experts, to make the technical issues clearer through metaphor and simple language,‚Äù he says.‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt overstate the uncertainties on the one hand, nor neglect to mention dangerous or unpleasant possibili- ties on the other. Our job is to provide the context‚Äîand that often is in the eye of the beholder, so expect conflicts.‚Äù

p22 This distinction, as to whether you are speaking as a scientist or as a citizen, is useful. In any given situation, ask yourself:Which hat am I wearing‚Äîmy scientist hat or my citizen hat? Then say so.

p29 Scientists and journalists may seem like they come from different planets, but in many ways they are more alike than different ... But when it comes to presenting their find- ings, scientists and journalists are utterly at odds. Journalists literally want to know your bot- tom line‚Äîfirst. To talk with them, you must turn what you normally do on its head and be-
gin with the conclusion.

p33 Differences between science and journalism
----------------------------------------
Science			Journalism
----------------------------------------
Slow and ongoing	Deadline-driven
Evidence first		Conclusions first
In-depth		Quick overview
Uncertainty		Certainty
Specifics		Generalizations
Credentials		Perspectives
Rational		Emotional
----------------------------------------

p34 One of the biggest differences between the cultures of scientists and journal- ists is who looks over their shoulders‚Äîin other words, whose judgment they value. In interviews, scientists often answer questions as if they were talking to other scientists.This is because they can hear the judgment of their colleagues ringing in their ears:‚ÄúDid I forget someone I should have acknowledged? Did I sound silly? Will I have offended anyone?‚Äù An important part of be- coming an effective science communicator is to stop talking to your peers. Start thinking about what the journalist and his or her audience needs from you: clear, concise, conversational answers. %ÊòØÁöÑÔºåÊàëÊúâÂêåÊÑü„ÄÇÊàëÊúâÊôÇ‰∏çÊï¢Ë™™Ë©±ÊàñÂØ´‰ΩúÊòØÂÆ≥ÊÄï‰æÜËá™BertÂ≠∏ÁîüÁöÑÂò≤Ë´∑ÂºèË≤†Èù¢Ë©ïÂÉπ„ÄÇ
