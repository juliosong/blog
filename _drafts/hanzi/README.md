This new series records my journey of Chinese character study. I write it as an exercise to summarize what I learned about the evolution of commonly used characters. 

Format: 3 characters per post - it will take me three months to finish the 170 characters in my Han4 Zi4 Lian4 Xi2 notebook. 

Aim: just describe objectively - no need to embellish.
