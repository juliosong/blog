![Oracle bone script Hua4](/assets/images/hanzi/hua-obs.png)
This oracle-bone-script (OBS) character consists of three parts: a hand (upper right), a brush pen (upper), and some marks created with the pen (lower). It means drawing lines and especially boundaries with pen.
![Bronze script Hua4](/assets/images/hanzi/hua-bs.png)
The bronze-script (BS) version of the same character draws the hand part more vividly, clearly showing the fingers holding the pen. Besides, the marks produced by the pen have also adapted a new shape, which looks like a piece of square farming land divided evenly into four smaller squares. The meaning of the character stays the same: drawing boundaries with pen.
![Seal script Hua4](/assets/images/hanzi/hua-ss.png)
The seal-script (SS) version of the character looks less like doodling and more like standardized writing. It's not only more neatly structured but also has extra decorations further signaling the intended meaning. Thus, the arm part of the hand is shortened, the brush head part of the pen lengthened, and four short lines are added around the farming land to show that the land is not only divided internally but also framed externally, presumably as boundaries with neighboring land pieces.

![Standard traditional script Hua4](/assets/images/hanzi/hua-sts.png)

The standard-traditional-script (STS) version of the character is regularized; namely, its strokes and structuring become more square than round. The basic shape of the character is kept, with two changes: (i) the brush head of the pen becomes a plus-sign-like stroke (+); (ii) the four outer-boundary-indicating short lines around the farming land are reduced to two (above and below the land).
