It has been a month since I moved to city H, where I am lying lazily in my *chaise longue* now and updating my personal blog as the evening approaches. I raise my head from time to time to look at the busy street outside my window. For some reason the hustle and bustle out there does not really bother me, perhaps because it is raining today and my apartment is on the eighth floor, from where lower buildings look like cardboard boxes and passing vehicles look like lego pieces, whose winking beams are like flaring candles lit by the metropolitan neon lights.
