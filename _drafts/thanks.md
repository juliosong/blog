Why are apples so important?

Many years ago, probably when I was in grade six or seven, I accidentally overheard the following snippet from a family conversation. The speaker was the wife of one of my elder cousins and the theme was my then three-year-old nephew: 
>The other day when I picked him up from the kindergarten, he told me excitedly, "mom, today I learned English!" I asked, "What did you learn?" "_Apple_," he answered.

Why do I still remember this trifling life detail from nearly two decades ago? Maybe partly because it's so predictable---ask a ten-year-old Chinese kid what English words they know and they very likely will say "apple."  _Apple_ is indeed a (or even **the**) first English word kids learn in or out of classes in China---or at least it's one of the most memorable words. I can't really remember which was my own first English word---perhaps also _apple_---but I'm sure I already knew _apple_ by the time when I learned _sorry_ or _thank you_ (basically anything communicative). 

But why should it be so? Why do kids first learn _apple_? One reason I had thought of was that _apple_ starts with an _a_, which is the first letter in the English alphabet. So, maybe among all words starting with _a_ "apple" happens to be the conventional example teachers give (though one could ask further why that should be the case).

However, I soon realized that that couldn't be the whole story, because even when I learned other languages where the word for "apple" didn't begin with "a," or languages that didn't have an alphabet at all, the very first word I (remember I) learned is still "apple"!
