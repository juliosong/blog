==Some curious letter words in Chinese==

As a professional linguistician I endorse [descriptivism](https://www.thoughtco.com/descriptivism-language-term-1690441) rather than [prescriptivism](https://www.thoughtco.com/prescriptivism-language-1691669) in the scientific study of language. However, as a language user I am to some extent a "[purist](https://www.thoughtco.com/purism-language-1691704)," especially when it comes to lexical choices in my mother tongue---that is, choices as to which words (not) to use.  

[insert illustration of descriptivism vs. prescriptivism]

For example, I usually avoid using non-Chinese words when speaking Chinese, and I painstakingly stick to native vocabulary when speaking my local vernacular instead of resorting to loan words from Standard Mandarin as most young/middle-aged adults do. Actually my way of speaking is so "dialectal" that my relatives back home often jokingly ridicule me as "old-fashioned" and "nothing like a university graduate." Once I used the native word for "school" at my cousin's, and she laughingly commented that only people of our grandma's age spoke that way.

Sometimes I stubbornly use native Chinese words because the more common international (mostly English) expressions are in fact inaccurate or downright mistakes. This is especially common for English-origin abbreviations, which have caught on among Chinese speakers for various reasons and stayed in popular vocabulary. For example, I don't get it why many people in China, academics included, insist on calling presentation slides "PPTs," even when it's obvious that the document doesn't have a .ppt(x) extension. Normally I wouldn't point this out because I understand that Chinese speakers probably have established a new vocabulary item in their mental lexicon that is merely homophonous with the English filename extension, as in (1), 

(1) PPT<sub>Chinese</sub> := <`/'pi:'pi:'ti:/`, "a generic term for all presentation slides"> â‰ <br> PPT<sub>English</sub> := <`/'pi:'pi:'ti:/`, "the file format used by Microsoft PowerPoint presentation software">

but it does get a bit frustrating when people also assume that all slides are created by Microsoft PowerPoint and specifically ask me for a .ppt file (when all they need is just an editable version of my slides).

So perhaps one could say the English abbreviation "ppt" and the Chinese word "PPT" have now become a pair of [false friends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_friend), just like English _magazine_ and French _magasin_ 'shop'. 

Further examples like "PPT" can be easily found. For instance, I've noticed that many Chinese variety show hosts love using "VCR" to mean "video clip," as in sentences like "let's watch a VCR (= video clips)" and "in the VCR (= video clip) we've watched just now." I'm not sure who initiated this fashion under what circumstances, but it's clearly wrong if one understands what the acronym stands for. It stands for _video cassette recorder_ (i.e., an electronic device) and to my best knowledge hasn't been semantically expanded in English. So, the semantic expansion described above can only be a Chinese-specific phenomenon. 

Another popular example is "MP3," which is another filename extension in English but has come to mean any music file as well as a particular type of music player in Chinese. In particular, the meaning generalization of "MP3" from a subcategory to its superordinate category is similar to that of "PPT," which in itself might be an interesting linguistic phenomenon to research on.
