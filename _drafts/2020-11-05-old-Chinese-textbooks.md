In this post I introduce some old Chinese textbooks from history.

Marshman 1814, preface, A2: ...in a language which differs so entirely from all others, it seemed impossible to do justice to either its Written or Colloquial medium, within the space generally allotted in other grammars to the letters and their various powers. to the author they seemed to deserve a separate essay: the grammatical part of the work is therefore preceded by a Preliminary Essay on the Characters and Colloqiual medium of the Chinese.

A3: in the first part of the preliminary essay, which is devoted to the characters, an attempt is made to ascertain their origin.
