The sentence in the title of this post may sound awkward to an English speaker's ears---How can one copy a filename extension to another?---but it turns out to be a perfectly grammatical utterance in Chinese (<a href='#jump'>jump to the translation</a> if you can't wait), at least in [the Chinese variety standardly spoken on the mainland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Chinese), where "[letter words](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4157)" (<span class='hanyu'>Â≠óÊØçË©û</span>) such as _ppt_ and _mp3_ have become increasingly popular in recent years. In fact, they have gained so much momentum that a dedicated list of "words beginning with Western letters" has been added to the authoritative [_Contemporary Chinese Dictionary_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiandai_Hanyu_Cidian#Traditional_Chinese_edition) (<span class='hanyu'>Áèæ‰ª£Êº¢Ë™ûË©ûÂÖ∏</span>) since its third edition (1996). And according to [a survey](https://baike.baidu.com/reference/23532839/3432Rtn2S4atX_R1d-0XXjsPHYa3kaoZQ7VPyDWzAyhoJLS9S_Cz4h9fUcyodOj118rey3YamCu9cdXhMSxFNj0OQ65TZHoEEGE_5ZT4RKgSHEqX3m4mF_XUzNM) conducted by the PRC State Language Commission in 2019, two out of the top ten Internet buzzwords in Mandarin Chinese in 2018 are letter words ([_skr_](https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d3d674e30596a4d79457a6333566d54/share_p.html) and [_C<span class='hanyu'>‰Ωç</span>_](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/C‰Ωç)).

What makes letter words special in Chinese is exactly their alphabetic nature. As is well known, the Chinese writing system is not alphabetic but based on pictographic or phonosemantic logograms (aka [Chinese characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters)). As such, letter words are in a sense "intruders" in Chinese texts.

## Letter words vs. loanwords
Letter words are not necessarily loanwords (though many of them are). A [loanword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanword) is a word that is adopted from one language and incorporated into another without translation, such as English _caf√©_ (French-origin) and _kindergarten_ (German-origin). **Loanwords in Chinese are usually assigned dedicated characters based on their sounds,** such as <span class='hanyu'>Ê≤ôÁôº</span> _sha1fa1_ 'sofa' and <span class='hanyu'>Â∑ßÂÖãÂäõ</span> _qiao3ke4li4_ 'chocolate'. The technical term for this methodology is _jia3jie4_ (<span class='hanyu'>ÂÅáÂÄü</span>) or [_rebus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_characters#Rebus), which is one of the oldest principles of character formation in the language.

Letter words, on the other hand, are simply written in letters. The majority of them are abbreviations based on the latin alphabet and pronounced in the English way; for example, the alphabetic part of the letter word _ATM<span class='hanyu'>Ê©ü</span>_ 'ATM machine' is just read as [Àåe…™Àåt ∞iÀêÀà…õm] (or [e…™À•-t ∞iÀêÀ•-a…õÀßÀ•-m(…Ø)] if you wanna sound "native"). That being said, **many letter words in Chinese actually don't exist in English (or other languages using the latin alphabet) but are coined by Chinese speakers themselves,** so an average English speaker wouldn't be able to understand them at once. Some well-known examples of this kind are _AA<span class='hanyu'>Âà∂</span>_ 'to go Dutch' (allegedly from _algebraic average_), _HSK_ 'Chinese Proficiency Test' (= [_Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanyu_Shuiping_Kaoshi) <span class='hanyu'>Êº¢Ë™ûÊ∞¥Âπ≥ËÄÉË©¶</span>), and _CCTV_ 'China Central Television' (**not** closed-circuit television). Interestingly, from _AA<span class='hanyu'>Âà∂</span>_ there have been derived two new terms _AO<span class='hanyu'>Âà∂</span>_ and _AB<span class='hanyu'>Âà∂</span>_. Can you figure out what they mean?ü§ì See [this page](http://ahwoof.blogspot.com/2017/11/aa-ab-and-ao.html) for an explanation.

In sum, letter words are a separate category from loanwords in Chinese. The two categories partly overlap but aren't the same.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/letter-word-venn.png" alt="a Venn diagram showing the relationship between letter words and loanwords in Chinese" caption="Letter words and loanwords overlap but aren't the same category in Chinese." %}

So, which category do the two abbreviations in the title (i.e., _ppt_ and _mp3_) go into? We may call them "loan letter words," though their meanings in Chinese differ a bit from their original meanings in English. In Chinese, they mean the following:
- **ppt:** (1) any presentation file, including but not limited to files produced by MS PowerPoint; (2) a single slide in a presentation.
- **mp3:** (1) an MP3 player; (2) any music file, including but not limited to files with an `.mp3` extension.

Thus, what a Chinese speaker really means by the sentence in the title of this post is "Can I copy your presentation file onto my MP3 player (which I use as a handy data storage device)?" And believe me, this is not a rare request at all---back in high school I used to use my MP3 player as a USB flash disk all the time!

## Semantic shift in loan letter words
Now I'll go a bit deeper into the usage of _ppt_ and _mp3_ in Chinese. In everyday contexts one may happily refer to a presentation as "a ppt" (1<span class='hanyu'>ÂÄã</span>ppt) even when it clearly has a `.pdf` or `.keynote` extension, and a single slide in a presentation is simply called "one page (of) ppt" (1<span class='hanyu'>È†Å</span>ppt). Here the two senses of _ppt_ are solely distinguished by their [classifiers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classifier_(linguistics)) (i.e., measure words); namely, the generic <span class='hanyu'>ÂÄã</span> _ge4_ (for anything countable) and the more specific <span class='hanyu'>È†Å</span> _ye4_ (for pages).

Similarly, the two senses of _mp3_ are also distinguished by their classifiers in daily usage. Compare the two sentences below for example:
1. <span class='hanyu'>Êò®Â§©ÊàëË≤∑‰∫Ü‰∏ÄÂÄãmp3.</span><br>
`transcription` wo3 zuo2tian1 mai3le yi2 ge4 mp3<br>
`verbatim gloss` I yesterday bought one &lt;classifier&gt; mp3<br>
`free translation` "I bought an MP3 player yesterday."<br>
(the classifier is <span class='hanyu'>ÂÄã</span> _ge4_)
2. <span class='hanyu'>ÊàëÁµ¶‰Ω†‰∏ã‰∫ÜÂπæÈ¶ñmp3.</span><br>
wo3 gei3 ni3 xia4le ji3 shou3 mp3<br>
I for you downloaded several &lt;classifier&gt; mp3<br>
"I downloaded a few music files (e.g., songs) for you."<br>
(the classifier is <span class='hanyu'>È¶ñ</span> _shou3_, for songs and poems)

**It is not uncommon for loanwords to acquire new meanings in the target language,** which is just [semantic shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_change) over time (a type of language change)---more specifically semantic widening or generalization in our cases at hand. This is a regular phenomenon in world languages regardless of etymology. For example, _hoover_ originally only referred to a particular brand of vacuum cleaner but has now come to mean any type of vacuum cleaner. Loanwords are no exception to semantic shift, for once a foreign word is imported, it becomes part of the receiving language and can be normally targeted by linguistic rules in the language. Thus, while the plural form of _Kindergarten_ in German is _Kinderg√§rten_, it is _kindergartens_ in English, following the English rule.

As such, the fact that _ppt_ and _mp3_ have undergone Chinese-specific semantic shift (i.e., a shift unavailable in English) is also no surprise. Moreover, it is evidence that they have been "deforeignized" and truly become part of the Chinese lexicon (despite their alphabetic appearance). I guess they wouldn't cause trouble if they're fully localized (i.e., written in Chinese characters) either, though no one bothers completing this last step in an era where most educated citizens (especially netizens) have English as their second language since elementary school.
