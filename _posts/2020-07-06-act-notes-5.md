In the [previous four posts](https://blog.juliosong.com/mathematics/act-notes-1/) I organized my notes from the ACT2020 Tutorial Day. In this post I'll continue to note down things I've learned from the main sessions. I'll keep updating this post till the end of the conference.üë®‚Äçüíª

Since most talks employ advanced category-theoretic techniques and are about subjects I'm not familiar with, I won't attempt to recap their results. **I'll merely make a list of concepts that I repeatedly heard at the conference instead,** which sort of serves as a learning agenda for myself.

## Days 1‚Äì2
*(Unfortunately I had to miss a good part of Day 2's talks due to a clash with my local duty, but fortunately all talks have been made [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCOXjXDLt3pYot9VNdLlZqGajHyZUywdI) so that I have managed to catch up.)*

### Petri net
The first talk on Day 1 was about "Petri nets," and several other talks on the same day were also centered on this concept. I had seen this term before---probably also in the ACT literature---but had never engaged with it or looked it up, because it felt so far-away from my own discipline. This time I took the time to do a bit googling and acquainted myself with the basics of this graphical device. I find [this web page](https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~mchen/BioPNML/Intro/pnfaq.html) from Bielefeld University and [this blog post](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/petri-nets/) by John Baez easy to follow. The picture below is a Petri net:

A [petri net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net), as Wikipedia puts it, is mathematically a *directed bipartite graph*. It consists of circles called *places* and rectangles called *transitions*. Places hold *tokens* and arcs have *capacity numbers*. Here when $T1$ "fires," the single token in $P1$ will be transmitted into $P2$.

Apparently Petri nets are widely used throughout science, and the Petri net‚Äìrelated talks all aim to propose category-theoretic structures to efficiently model them. The **basic idea** seems to be that a certain [free category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_category) can be generated from the data of a petri net, which in turn extends to a functor from a category of Petri nets to a category of categories. The freely generated category has a certain type of monoidal structure. Two recent papers by John Baez and his student Jade Master contain more detail ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09091v2), [2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/article/open-petri-nets/4D1BC7F05BE8CB0C83C65F7CDF70AF2F)).

### system theory
I learned that "[categorical system theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092824083800779)" was a well-established area of study. There are perhaps more than one way to categorically examine systems, and there are multiple types of system as well. [Jules Hedges' talk](https://obsoletewallstreet.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/categorical_systems_theory.pdf) focused on "[open systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory))," which are viewed as categorical *morphisms*. Boundaries between those systems, on the other hand, are viewed as *objects*. Under this setting, composing morphisms is just connecting boundaries, which Hedges illustrated with the following string diagram:

![a string diagram for open system composition](/assets/images/act2020-5-2.png){:width="45%"}

Here the composite system $g\circ f$ is formed by joining their boundary $y$. I hadn't paid much attention to system theory before but might take a look at it later. One thing I'm curious about is what the extension of the term "system" is in the context of categorical system theory. Does it only cover situations where multiple systems interact with one another or are sole systems without any external interaction also included? I'm guessing the latter type of system is not as interesting to category theorists as the former because of its lack of intricate compositionality.

### optics
I noticed quite a few talks on the program had a "lens" in their titles. I didn't know what it meant and wondered whether it was about physics üòÖ. But it turned out that both "lens" and "optics" were just metaphors to describe certain programming concepts. [This blog post](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/algebraic) has a detailed illustration of those concepts as they are used in Haskell (the author also has a nice [book](https://leanpub.com/optics-by-example) on the topic), and [this blog post](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/01/profunctor_optics_the_categori.html) takes a more category-theoretic approach.

Simply put, optics are a family of data accessors in functional programming. They come in multiple sorts, including lenses, prisms, and so on. Take lenses for example, they can retrieve subparts of data, update them, and then insert them back in place. This process is mathematically modeled by two maps ([Riley's formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00738v2)): $\mathrm{Get}: S\rightarrow A$ and $\mathrm{Put}: S \times A \rightarrow S$, where $S$ is the ambient data and $A$ is the subpart of it that gets manipulated via the lens. I guess the term "lens" might have been chosen because this process felt like inspecting the internal structure of the ambient data through a peephole?

The techniques used in the categorification of optics (e.g., end, profunctor) are fairly advanced, and I don't think I can hope to understand them anytime soon. But I'll come back and update this part if I eventually manage to conquer them someday.

### monoidal category
If I were allowed to list only one takeaway message from ACT2020, it must be that [monoidal categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category) are everywhere in applied category theory. For instance, each of the three aforementioned concepts involves some sort of monoidal category.

I don't think this necessarily means one cannot do applied category theory without using monoidal categories (I, for one, didn't use it in [my poster](https://www.juliosong.com/doc/act2020poster/poster.html)). It could also just be that most people in the ACT community happen to have a shared interest or come from subject areas where monoidal patterns are commonly seen---basically whenever you do combinatory stuff there's a chance that you're dealing with monoidal structures (in a sense "monoidal" just means combining things, in whatever way the context defines). And so far I haven't found monoidal categories useful in my own work simply because I'm not doing combinatory stuff (and indeed monoidal categories pop up in linguistics too if you happen to be working on the combinatory side of language).

But anyway, if one wants to get the most out of the ACT experience, knowing the basics of monoidal categories is a must. It's just that beginner-friendly tutorials on them are hard to find (I might try and compose one if I ever lay my hands on a sequel to my [Category Theory notes](https://blog.juliosong.com/linguistics/mathematics/category-theory-notes-1/) series üòõ). As I mentioned in my [notes](https://blog.juliosong.com/mathematics/act-notes-2/) from the second lecture of the Tutorial Day, monoidal categories aren't taught in elementary textbooks of category theory for nonmathematician beginners. Fong & Spivak do teach them with multidisciplinary examples in [their textbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316), but those are only helpful if one is familiar with the relevant disciplines. So far the most patient and comprehensive introduction I've seen is Baez & Stay's 73-page manuscript entitled "[Physics, topology, logic and computation: A Rosetta Stone](https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340v3)," but again maybe I've only found it easy to follow because I have some background knowledge of logic and computation.

So, at the end of the day, **category theory isn't really a theory for anyone and everyone**. The more STEM background you have, the easier it is for you to understand the examples and thereby the categorical concepts. I'd be surprised (in a good way) if one day someone should write a (nontrivial) textbook for *absolute* beginners, say first-year undergrads majoring in literature or history. That'd be a greatest pedagogical achievement in ACT and I'd definitely write an exuberant review of it.üòé
