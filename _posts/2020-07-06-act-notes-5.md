In the [previous four posts](https://blog.juliosong.com/mathematics/act-notes-1/) I organized my notes from the ACT2020 Tutorial Day. In this post I'll continue to note down things I've learned from the main sessions. I'll keep updating this post till the end of the conference.üë®‚Äçüíª

Since most talks employ advanced category-theoretic techniques and are about subjects I'm not familiar with, I won't attempt to recap their results. **I'll merely make a list of concepts that I repeatedly heard at the conference instead,** which sort of serves as a learning agenda for myself.

## Days 1‚Äì2
*(Unfortunately I had to miss a good part of Day 2's talks due to a clash with my local duty, but fortunately all talks have been made [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCOXjXDLt3pYot9VNdLlZqGajHyZUywdI) so that I have managed to catch up.)*

### Petri net
The first talk on Day 1 was about "Petri nets," and several other talks on the same day were also centered on this concept. I had seen this term before---probably also in the ACT literature---but had never engaged with it or looked it up, because it felt so far-away from my own discipline. This time I took the time to do a bit googling and acquainted myself with the basics of this graphical device. I find [this web page](https://www.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/~mchen/BioPNML/Intro/pnfaq.html) from Bielefeld University and [this blog post](https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/01/18/petri-nets/) by John Baez easy to follow. The picture below is a Petri net:

A [petri net](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net), as Wikipedia puts it, is mathematically a *directed bipartite graph*. It consists of circles called *places* and rectangles called *transitions*. Places hold *tokens* and arcs have *capacity numbers*. Here when $T1$ "fires," the single token in $P1$ will be transmitted into $P2$.

Apparently Petri nets are widely used throughout science, and the Petri net‚Äìrelated talks all aim to propose category-theoretic structures to efficiently model them. The **basic idea** seems to be that a certain kind of [free category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_category) can be generated from the data of a Petri net, which in turn extends to a functor from a category of Petri nets to a category of categories. The freely generated category has a particular type of monoidal structure. Two recent papers by John Baez and his student Jade Master contain more detail ([1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.09091v2), [2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/article/open-petri-nets/4D1BC7F05BE8CB0C83C65F7CDF70AF2F)).

### system theory
I learned that "[categorical system theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092824083800779)" was an established area of study. There are perhaps more than one way to examine systems categorically, and there are surely multiple types of system as well. [Jules Hedges' talk](https://obsoletewallstreet.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/categorical_systems_theory.pdf) focused on "[open systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_system_(systems_theory))," which are viewed as categorical *morphisms*. Boundaries between those systems, on the other hand, are viewed as *objects*. Under this setting, composing morphisms is just connecting boundaries, which Hedges illustrated with the following string diagram:

![a string diagram for open system composition](/assets/images/act2020-5-2.png){:width="45%"}

Here the composite system $g\circ f$ is formed by joining the shared boundary $y$. I hadn't paid much attention to system theory before but might take a look at it later. One thing I'm curious about is what the extension of the term "system" is in the context of categorical system theory. Does it only cover situations where multiple systems interact with one another or are sole systems without external interaction also included? I'm guessing the latter type of system might not be as interesting to category theorists as the former because of its lack of intricate compositionality.

### optics
I noticed that quite a few talks on the program had a "lens" in their titles. I didn't know what it meant and naively wondered whether it was about physics üòÖ. But it turned out that both "lens" and "optics" were just metaphors describing certain programming concepts. [This blog post](https://chrispenner.ca/posts/algebraic) has a detailed illustration of those concepts as they are used in Haskell (the author also has a nice-looking [book](https://leanpub.com/optics-by-example) on the topic), and [this blog post](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2020/01/profunctor_optics_the_categori.html) takes a more category-theoretic approach.

Simply put, optics are a family of *data accessors* in [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming). They come in various subtypes, including lenses, prisms, and so on. Take lenses for example, they can retrieve subparts of some given data, update them, and then insert them back in place. To illustrate, the above-mentioned blog post uses postal addresses as a real-life example:

$$ \mathrm{viewZipCode}: \mathrm{Postal} \rightarrow \mathrm{Zip} $$<br>
$$ \mathrm{updateZipCode}: \mathrm{Postal} \times \mathrm{Zip} \rightarrow \mathrm{Postal} $$

The above functions say that we can (a) single out the zip code from a postal address to view it, and (b) update the zip code (i.e., replace it with some other zip code) and thereby get a new postal address. This process is mathematically modeled by two maps ([Riley's formulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00738v2)):

$$ \mathrm{Get}: S\rightarrow A $$<br>
$$ \mathrm{Put}: S \times A \rightarrow S $$

Here $S$ is the ambient data (e.g., an entire postal address) and $A$ is the subpart of it that gets manipulated via the lens (e.g., the zip code part of the postal address). I guess the term "lens" might have been chosen because this process felt like inspecting the internal structure of the ambient data through a peephole?

The techniques used in the categorification of optics (e.g., end, profunctor) are fairly advanced (see [this blog post](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2017/07/07/profunctor-optics-the-categorical-view/) for a patient introduction), and I don't think I can hope to understand them anytime soon. But I'll come back and update this part if I eventually manage to conquer them someday.

### monoidal category
If I were allowed to list only one takeaway message from ACT2020, it is that [monoidal categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category) are everywhere in applied category theory. For instance, each of the three aforementioned disciplinary concepts involves some variant of monoidal category.

I don't think this necessarily means one cannot do applied category theory without using monoidal categories, though. I, for one, didn't use it in [my poster](https://www.juliosong.com/doc/act2020poster/poster.html). It could just be that most people in the ACT community happen to have a shared interest or come from subject areas where monoidal patterns are commonly seen---basically whenever you do combinatory stuff there's a chance that you're dealing with monoidal structures (in a sense "monoidal" just means combining things, in whatever way the context defines). And so far I haven't found monoidal categories useful in my own work simply because I'm not doing combinatory stuff---monoidal categories pop up in linguistics too if we turn to address the combinatory side of language (as evidenced by categorial/pregroup grammars).

Anyway, if one wants to get the most out of the ACT experience, knowing the basics of monoidal categories is a must. Unfortunately layman-friendly tutorials on them are hard to find (I might try and compose one if I ever lay my hands on a sequel to my [Category Theory notes](https://blog.juliosong.com/linguistics/mathematics/category-theory-notes-1/) series üòõ). As I mentioned in my [notes](https://blog.juliosong.com/mathematics/act-notes-2/) from the Tutorial Day, monoidal categories aren't usually taught in elementary textbooks. Fong & Spivak do teach them with crossdisciplinary examples in [their ACT textbook](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316), but those are only helpful to the extent that one is familiar with the relevant disciplines. So far the most patient and comprehensive introduction to monoidal categories I've seen is Baez & Stay's 73-page manuscript entitled "[Physics, topology, logic and computation: A Rosetta Stone](https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340v3)," but again maybe I've only found it easy to follow because I have some background knowledge of logic and computation...

So, perhaps category theory isn't really a theory for anyone and everyone at the end of the day. The truth is, the more STEM background you have, the easier it is for you to understand the quintessential/motivating examples and thence the categorical concepts. I'd be surprised (in a good way) if one day someone decides to write a textbook for true outsiders, say first-year undergrads majoring in literature or history. That'd be a nontrivial pedagogical achievement in ACT and I'd definitely write an exuberant review of it.üòé
