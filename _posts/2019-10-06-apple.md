Many years ago, probably when I was in grade six or seven, I accidentally overheard the following snippet from a family conversation. The speaker was the wife of one of my elder cousins and the theme was my then three-year-old nephew:
>The other day when I picked him up from the kindergarten, he told me, "mom, today I learned English!" I asked, "What did you learn?" "_Apple_," he answered.

I haven't seen my nephew for ages, and perhaps he's already taller than me (which isn't a hard goal to achieve considering how tall my elder cousin is😆). But why do I still remember the above trifling conversation? Because of "apple"!

## We learn to say "apple" before everything else!
Not sure if it's just my illusion---please let me know if you have different opinions---but I have the impression that _apple_ is among the very first English words children get to learn in China, either in school or at home. In my own experience, I clearly remember that I had already known _apple_ for a long time by the time when I finally learned to say _sorry_ and _thank you_. This is certainly not the case for first-language acquirers, whose first words are usually _mama_, _papa_, or some other absolutely useful expressions for survival. **Why in the world would toothless infants want to say _apple_?**

Maybe _apple_ is taught early in China because it starts with an _a_, which happens to be the first letter in the English alphabet? That's plausible, though we could further ask why among all words starting with _a_ (e.g., _aunt_, _arm_, _angel_, _America_) it's _apple_ that gets the representative privilege.

Also, I realize that even when I try to learn other languages---languages where the word for "apple" doesn't begin with an "a" (e.g., Spanish _manzana_) or languages with no alphabetic scripts at all (e.g., Korean 사과 _sa-gwa_)---I still first learn to say "apple," before any kind of grammar learning kicked off. It seems to have become second nature to me to first learn to say "apple" when learning a new language, which sort of feels like an "appetizer."

While my "second nature" may just be a symptom of OCD, the fact that English teachers in China tend to teach _apple_ early is an objective observation. I guess the reason(s) for that might be among the following:
- _Apple_ begins with an _a_.
- The pronunciation of _apple_ doesn't contain any difficult phoneme.
- Apples are a most common type of fruit and therefore easy for teachers to think of.
- Apples are very healthy and teachers want to present healthy examples.
- Apples are consumed a lot in China, so there are a lot of opportunities for children to practice the word.
- Apples are mouth-watering and can help teachers get children's attention.
- The concept of apple is dully safe and won't cause teachers any trouble.

## We love apples!
Anyway, people worldwide love apples. In English, for example, there's the famous [proverb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_apple_a_day_keeps_the_doctor_away) "An apple a day keeps the doctor away." (I actually stopped eating apples for a while when I was writing my doctoral dissertation.😂) Jane Austen once [said](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/362411-good-apple-pies-are-a-considerable-part-of-our-domestic) "Good apple pies are a considerable part of our domestic happiness." And if you really adore someone, then they are "the apple of your eye."

Outside the English-speaking world, the Japanese [Fuji apples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuji_(apple)) have been deeply beloved of Asian people, and in China [sending apples to friends on Christmas Eve](https://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/11903/explainer-why-china-celebrates-christmas-with-apples) has become a symbol of best wishes and good luck, since the Chinese word for "apple" <span class="hanyu">蘋果</span> _píng-guǒ_ (more exactly its first syllable) is homophonous with (the first syllable of) the word for "safe and sound, peaceful" <span class="hanyu">平安</span> _píng-ān_. The fashion has caught on so well (thanks to commercialization) that even my mother, who lives in a tiny village and isn't religious at all, tells me to eat an apple ahead of Christmas every year.😇 She usually says:
><span class="hanyu">今天是平安夜，吃個蘋果，平平安安！</span><br>
>Today is "Peaceful Night" (the Chinese name for Christmas Eve). Eat an apple and be safe and sound!

Apples are not only delicious and healthy as such but also appear in various recipes either as a main or a side ingredient. Last year I fell in love with [McDonald's apple pie](https://www.mcdonalds.com/gb/en-gb/product/apple-pie.html), which is a superb library break snack on a cold winter night. And recently I've discovered a kind of "[apple sausage](https://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/price-lockdown-44/sainsburys-pork---bramley-apple-sausages--taste-the-difference-(gluten-free)-x6-400g?storeId=10151&langId=44&krypto=QuH1o8lI2%2Fr3nDHE6qyUImDnC%2F3EswlQ1XTFhzid5j66uB0R2KTIcsFEhUcPHIbVqj%2BTG1IK%2FzFFavr%2BNvkPzf3PG1tqBBQETzD3iMzdIepfb6R3r01UuAPi4YyMdudBRec6c3P%2Bfa05siqSSb9U3HRAnD9r6XfYtEkIHHfgxmY%3D&ddkey=https%3Agb%2Fgroceries%2Fprice-lockdown-44%2Fsainsburys-pork---bramley-apple-sausages--taste-the-difference-%28gluten-free%29-x6-400g)" in Sainsbury's, which tastes good as well.

## How to say apple in your language?
Apples have various names in European languages, such as English _apple_, Spanish _manzana_, and French _pomme_. They also have various names in East Asian languages, such as Mandarin <span class="hanyu">蘋果</span> _píng-guǒ_, Korean 사과 _sa-gwa_, and Japanese リンゴ _rin-go_. Just as most of the European names ultimately have a Latin or Greek origin, most of the East Asian names ultimately have a Chinese origin---except the current Chinese name itself, which [came from Sanskrit](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/蘋果) together with Buddhism in Tang Dynasty.

Both Korean _sa-gwa_ (<span class="hanyu">沙果</span>) and Japanese _rin-go_ (<span class="hanyu">林檎</span>) come from Middle Chinese names for apple. I'm not sure about the etymology of the former, but the latter is so-called because forest birds all love apples (the two characters <span class="hanyu">林檎</span> literally mean "forest Qin-fruit," where the character for Qin-fruit is just the character for birds equipped with a radical "tree").

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/ringo.png" alt="chinese characters for ringo" caption="The Japanese word for apple comes from Middle Chinese (see <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/林檎#Japanese'>Wiktionary</a>), which literally means &#8220;forest birds' fruit&#8221; (see <a href='http://chinese-linguipedia.org/search_inner.html?keywords=林檎'>chinese-linguipedia.org</a>). The Chinese pronunciations above are as in Mandarin (see <a href='https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/林檎#Chinese'>Wiktionary</a> for historical pronunciations)." %}

Other Middle Chinese names for the fruit include
- _nài_ <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/柰"><span class="hanyu">柰</span></a> (this is a character specially created for the fruit),
- _huā-hóng_ 'flower-red' <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/花紅"><span class="hanyu">花紅</span></a> (so-called because the fruit has red/pink flowers),
- _wén-lín-láng-guǒ_ 'the fruit of Wen Lin Lang [an official title]' <a href="https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/花红"><span class="hanyu">文林郎果</span></a> (so-called because allegedly an official in Tang Dynasty treated [Emperor Gaozong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Gaozong_of_Tang) to some delicious apples and thereby got the title Wen Lin Lang),

and so on. However, in Modern Chinese these alternative names have come to mean a different type of fruit (_malus asiatica_ or "[Chinese pearleaf crabapple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malus_asiatica)"; see [this page](http://www.jiaodui.com/bbs/read.php?tid=33800) for more historical details if you can read Chinese).

## Takeaway
In sum, it seems apples have been variously named globally. Their health-boosting effects are widely recognized, and their names are constantly being used as examples in foreign language teaching. There really aren't any reasons to dislike or debate over apples. So I think they definitely live up to the fashionable title "the fruit of peace" <span class="hanyu">平安果</span>.
