So I'm attending this year's Cambridge Comparative Syntax conference ([CamCoS 9](https://camcos9.wordpress.com)), not as a speaker or student helper this time but just as an audience member. I've been participating in the CamCoS conferences for a few years (basically since my first year of PhD) and can report from my personal experience that they are literally fantastic. This year's CamCoS is a special occasion for two reasons. First, it is organized in honor of Prof. Anders Holmberg's retirement. Second, it is entirely online due to the coronavirus pandemic.

This is the second online conference I've taken part in in 2020 (the last one was [ACT2020](https://blog.juliosong.com/mathematics/act-notes-1/)), and thank God my Internet connection this time is a lot better. The organizers (i.e., my dear old colleagues) have very considerately taken the global time differences into account, so this time I'm not forced to stay up till dawn either, though I reckon time zone flexibility is sort of becoming a new requirement for academics in the COVID era.

I decided to compile my notes from the conference into blog posts just like I had done last time for [ACT2020](https://blog.juliosong.com/mathematics/act-notes-1/) because I find blogging a helpful way to organize my own thoughts (and if anyone else finds these posts interesting then that's a bonus). Usually what happens when I go to a conference is that there's an awful lot of information, and even though I tend to feel enlightened multiple times during the day, things become so exhausting at the end that most of the newly acquired facts and ideas are simply forgotten alongside the handouts. But if I write down what I learned immediately afterward, then I can come back to look at it again later, like reliving part of my memory. So it's basically like writing a diary.

There are altogether five talks on the first day, respectively featuring Classical Chinese, Japanese/Tagalog, Russian, Czech/Polish/Arabic, and Niger-Congo languages (especially Burkinabé Bambara) as their main objects of study. Of course, each talk also assumes a more general comparative perspective as to how world languages differ from one another and tries to provide some sort of explanation for the crosslinguistic variation. I think that's one of the most attractive aspects of CamCoS, in that it really puts "variation" in the spotlight and encourages participants to look beyond our (linguistic) comfort zones. One could have a lot of serendipitous discoveries along the way.

This year's CamCoS has an overarching theme of "syntax vs. PF" (which, by the way, is a long-standing puzzle in the field); namely, whether parametric variation in human language is best accounted by (lexico)syntactic or (morpho)phonological means. Handouts and recordings of all talks can be found on the [conference website](https://camcos9.wordpress.com/programme/).

The first talk, by [Edith Aldridge](http://faculty.washington.edu/aldr/) and entitled "Syntactic parameter change in Early Middle Chinese," is about a salient grammatical change from Old to Modern Chinese. Aldridge's main proposal is that sentential subjects are licensed at the CP-level (i.e., Spec-CP) in Late Archaic Chinese (LAC, 5th–3th century B.C.E.) but at the TP-level (i.e., Spec-TP) from Early Middle Chinese (EMC, beginning in 1st century B.C.E.) on. There are a number of observable consequences following from this change, and Aldridge mainly discusses two such consequences: (i) the CP specifier position is freed up in EMC for object movement in main clauses; (ii) the CP domain (aka the left periphery) itself becomes more elaborate in EMC, with a number of topic and focus positions being added.

That modern syntactic theories can be used to study Classical Chinese interests me a lot, as I have only studied Classical Chinese on a pretheoretical, school-grammar level. Even though I am quite comfortable with Classical Chinese texts, I have had little idea as to what CP or TP corresponds to in it even long after I had stepped into linguistics. So, at least from an empirical perspective I am hugely impressed by Aldridge's work. I think the modern, generative syntactic perspective can actually help pupils learn Classical Chinese more efficiently, because many complex and not-entirely-clear school-grammar rules (especially those concerning functional morphemes and syntactic constructions), which used to be (and still are) taught and learned by rote, turn out to be components of a fully logical system.

The second talk, by [Kenyon Branan](https://linguistics.mit.edu/user/kbranan/) and entitled "Regimes of ordering," tackles the syntax-or-PF question directly, and the speaker's answer is that linguistic variation is located in phonology rather than syntax (I use both terms in a broad sense to avoid jargon). The particular phenomenon Branan looks into is [scrambling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambling_(linguistics)), which is just a fancy way of saying flexible word order (especially with regard to subjects and objects), such as that seen in languages like German and Russian. For example, in German one can say either *...dass der Mann der Frau die Bohnen gab* or *...dass die Bohnen der Mann der Frau gab* "...that the man gave the woman the beans," depending on the context ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrambling_(linguistics)#Examples)).

Branan observes that in the two flexible-word-order languages Japanese and Tagalog scrambling has different scope effects, which partly contradict the Lexical Correspondence Axiom (LCA) put forward in Kayne's (1994) seminal book [*The Antisymmetry of Syntax*](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/antisymmetry-syntax), and he explains away the contradiction by proposing two PF restrictions "Exit" and "Re-entry," which work in tandem with the LCA and essentially exempt certain phrases from it. Since I'm not familiar with Tagalog grammar (though I do want to learn a bit Tagalog), I don't have much to say about the particular proposal of the talk. From a general theoretical perspective, however, I feel the syntax-plus-PF approach is on the right track. Language is a highly complex natural phenomenon, so it's nothing surprising if it turns out that both syntax and PF play a role in regulating parametric variation. I personally favor such an eclectic approach because if the whole universe isn't black-and-white, why should language or the human mind be?

The third talk, by [Elena Titov](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-elena-titov) and entitled "Syntactic parameters: The case of IS-conditioned argument reordering," also focuses on the flexible word order of verbal arguments (such as subjects and objects), so I guess it falls under the same empirical domain as the second talk (which may or may not be the reason why they have been put on the same day). The "IS" in the title of the talk is short for "[Information Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_structure)," which is just a fancy way of saying discourse-related grammatical categories like focus and topic. Titov's view on the syntax-or-PF issue is strongly pro-PF. In particular, she proposes that what lies behind the scrambling effects in languages like Russian is (partly) the notion of interpretive prominence, which essentially creates a non-syntactically-determined asymmetry among the various verbal arguments, whence their word order flexibility.

While I find the analysis largely coherent for the Russian data, I don't think it provides strong evidence for a pro-PF (or more exactly antilexicosyntax) view on parametric variation. In particular, I don't think the currently mainstream practice of encoding parametric variation at the lexicon-syntax interface (i.e., in terms of functional categories) means encoding it in the narrow syntax (which is basically just Merge in the current Chomskyan view), because functional categories are functional categories and Merge is Merge---the two cannot be mixed up. As such, I personally don't think Titov's argument that feature-based accounts of parametric variation are problematic in view of evolutionary biology (i.e., the view that the syntactic component of the human language faculty has remained unchanged since its evolutionary appearance) is a real argument. The narrow syntax (aka Merge) doesn't change, but functional categories and formal features, which are stored in the lexicon rather than in the narrow syntax (how can an operation like Merge possibly store things anyway?), surely can.

The fourth talk (also the first "speed talk"), by [Ivona Kučerová](https://www.humanities.mcmaster.ca/~kucerov/mcmaster/Ivona_Kucerova.html) and [Adam Szczegielniak](https://scholar.harvard.edu/adam/home) and entitled "Syntactic variation meets PF uniformity; Underspecification of nominal functional categories," addresses the interesting phenomenon of structural homophony; that is, homophony across grammatical categories. For example, the phoneme /k/ appears in gender, number, and case inflection in a number of Slavic languages (e.g., Czech, Polish), and the phoneme /f/ appears in categories like division/number and nominalization in Arabic. The main proposal in this talk is that both Slavic /k/ and Arabic /f/ are realizations of the same underspecified functional head, which the authors dub as $i^*$ (loosely inspired by Wood & Marantz 2015). This head operates on syntactic features and toggle their values (e.g., from - to +).

I find the idea in this talk exciting, but alongside the excitement also comes a number of potential technical pitfalls (as is typically the case with highly creative ideas). For example, the almighty $i^* $ needs to operate on some feature(s), but how exactly those features are derivationally selected remains unclear (nor does it seem completely deterministic as the speaker points out). In addition, since $i^* $ is defined as a polarity-toggling head, the proposal in the talk necessarily relies on a particular version of feature theory, where all relevant features have boolean values (otherwise the polarity toggling won't work). So what might the theory say about nonboolean features (e.g., features in the [att: val] format) also remains unclear. The above being said, I do think the idea in this talk is worth further exploring.

The fifth and final talk of the first day, by [Elena Callegari](https://uu.academia.edu/elenacallegari) and entitled "Focus markers in an optionally WH-in-situ language: the case of Burkinabé Bambara," examines focus marking in several [Manding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manding_languages) ([Niger-Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger–Congo_languages)) languages, partly in comparison with Italian. Unlike the first four talks, this talk is more empirical than theoretical. It presents a wide range of crosslinguistic data and carefully shows the subtle interpretative differences with regard to the several focus markers. While I'm a total layman in African languages, I do find this talk fairly easy to follow, partly because the slides are colorful and have large fonts (I should definitely learn from the speaker in this respect!). The main takeaway of the talk is that there is considerable crosslinguistic variation as to which types of focus matter for syntactic phenomena, which I think partly converges with one of the conclusions in Aldridge's talk; namely, the left periphery of human language syntax isn't really universally fixed (pace the cartographic theory).

In sum, four out of the five talks on the first day (i.e., except the fourth talk) are concerned with the discourse domain of human language syntax, especially with topic and focus categories. I personally haven't studied this domain in detail but might start taking a deeper look into it after CamCoS 9, especially in relation to Classical Chinese. I might even write a blog series on this in the future. 😃
