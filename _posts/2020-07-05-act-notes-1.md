So I'm participating in this year's [Applied Category Theory conference](https://act2020.mit.edu/#tutorialday) (with a virtual poster---check it out [here](https://www.juliosong.com/doc/act2020poster/poster.html)!), and the preconference [Tutorial Day](https://act2020.mit.edu/#tutorialday) has just kicked off. This post summarizes my notes from the first lecture given by [David Spivak](http://math.mit.edu/~dspivak/). And I'll keep posting my conference notes on my blog in the upcoming week.

The [first lecture](https://youtu.be/cJ46AOEOc14) is entitled "Introduction to Applied Category Theory," where David introduced to the audience some basic categorical ideas in nontechnical terms. He began the lecture by roughly describing a category as a network of relations and category theory as a field that thinks math as a whole and attempts to find general patterns that persist throughout math, where math, in his words, encompasses stable thought patterns that can last for a very long time.

> Category theorists invent categories all the time. (DS)

Next, David went on to illustrate what category theory is by presenting a very small toy category (a lattice of natural number division), where he introduced a product of $a$ and $b$ as the last thing that goes into both $a$ and $b$, which in the toy example was just the greatest common divisor of two natural numbers. More generally, a product in a preordered set in a greatest lower bound, as [Jade Master](https://sites.google.com/view/jadeedenstarmaster/home) pointed out in the conference Zoom chat.

After the toy example, we were presented with two general remarks about category theory:
- Category theory looks for common patterns throughout math, and beyond [which is where applied category theory becomes relevant].
- Category theory was invented (1940s) to consider bridges between [many fields of math]. In a sense the very project of math itself is being considered in category theory.

To illustrate, David named a few renowned scholars and the fields/concepts they respectively invented:
- Euclid: shapes, lines, geometry
- Newton/Leibniz: rates of change
- Pascal/Fermat: probability
- Boole: formal logic
- Noether: abstract algebra
- Turing: computation

> All of math was invented by someone to help them think about some aspect of their world. (DS)

Next, David gave a few more established examples of what category theory can do, including a category of resources and processes (which is discussed in detail in his coauthored book [with [Brendan Fong](http://www.brendanfong.com)] [*Seven Sketches in Compositionality*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05316)), a category of algebraic systems of equations (e.g., the two systems of equations [$y - x^2 = 3, y + x = 9$] and [$x = 2, y = 7$] qua categorical objects are connected), and a category of formal logic among others (e.g., the deductions "if A or B then C" and "if A then C and if B then C" are equivalent).

Finally, David perceived category theory from a number of "sociological" angles. To name a few:
- conservative: benefits from wisdom of math already invented
- libertarian: you are free to create as you see fit, working within a background framework that is minimally invasive but highly functional
- progressive: everyone can contribute to making a richer, more meaningful field
- postmodern: no perspective is "right," and navigating between perspectives lets you look at a problem from all sides
- hippy: it's all about relationship and connection
- practitioner: used to organize and learn from "big data," manage complexity of large and evolving software projects...

So it seems category theory does have a pleasing facet to everyone!
