In this third lecture by [Emily Riehl](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/), we are shown a particular use of the Yoneda lemma in the category of matrices. Emily has put [her slides](http://www.math.jhu.edu/~eriehl/matrices.pdf) online, so in this post I won't repeat the content that is already in her slides. I'll note down my personal understanding of the example instead, which I think might be useful to category theory learners who are as "ignorant" in matrix theory as I am.

Emily first commented that the Yoneda lemma was everywhere and like a magic tool, though she also acknowledged that it was very hard for beginners and that the understanding of it could be a long, slow process. Then she went on to introduce the category $\mathbf{Mat}$ of matrices, whose objects are natural numbers and morphisms are matrices. She used this category to illustrate how the Yoneda lemma could be used in mathematics.

I don't know matrix theory at all, and even though now I understand the most basic definitions after a quick Google search, I'm still far from ready to learn something as mind-boggling as the Yoneda lemma through it. But the good thing about category theory is that it is so abstract and general that you don't really need to properly grasp a subject in order to understand the application of category-theoretic ideas---as long as the application is correct, you just need to substitute or "localize" a few things, and the gist will become transparent.

So, following is my personal understanding of how the Yoneda lemma is used in the matrix category. First off, Emily's basic categorical setting involves $\mathbf{Mat}$, $\mathbf{Set}$, and two functors between them: a specific $k$-column functor $h_k$ and another random $j$-column functor. There is a natural transformation $\alpha$ from the former to the latter, which is interpreted as a naturally-defined column operation that transforms matrices with $k$ columns into matrices with $j$ columns. I illustrate this setting diagrammatically below:

Now, what the $k$-column functor (and similarly the $j$-column functor) does is that it fixes the column number of a matrix as $k$ and lets its row number vary. Thus, for each possible row number $n$ as input it will yield a particular set of $n\times k$ matrices as output. So, $h_k$ as a functor can effectively be rewritten as $- \times k$, where $-$ is the usual blank placeholder in category theory. Similarly, $h_j$ can be rewritten as $-\times j$. For some reason I find these alternative notations easier to understand, maybe because they are more transparent in terms of what the functors do. So, we can now rewrite the above diagram as follows:

Under this setting, Emily's question was how to describe all natural transformations of the form $\alpha$? Namely, how to classify all naturally-defined column operations that transform matrices with $k$ columns into matrices with $j$ columns?

> This is exactly the kind of question that the Yoneda lemma is going to answer. (ER)

The solution she gave out was the following:
- Every naturally-defined column operation $\alpha: h_k \rightarrow h_j$ is determined by a single $k\times j$ matrix.
- This $k\times j$ matrix $\alpha_k(I_k): j\rightarrow k$ is obtained by applying the column operation $\alpha_k$ to the identity matrix $I_k: k\rightarrow k$.
- The column operation $\alpha_n: h_k(n)\rightarrow h_j(n)$ is then defined by right multiplication by the matrix $\alpha_k(I_k):j\rightarrow k$.

Recall the textbook definition of the Yoneda lemma
> **Yoneda lemma:** Let $\mathbb{C}$ be locally small. For any object $C\in\mathbb{C}$ and functor $F\in\mathbf{Sets}^{\mathbb{C}^{op}},$ there is an isomorphism
\\[ Hom(yC, F) \cong FC \\]
which, moreover, is natural in both $F$ and $C.$ (Category Theory, pp.&nbsp;188--189)

and that of the Yoneda functor (aka Yoneda embedding)
>The Yoneda embedding is the functor $y\colon \mathbb{C}\rightarrow\mathbf{Sets}^{\mathbb{C}^{\mathrm{op}}}$ taking $C\in\mathbb{C}$ to the contravariant representable functor
\\[ yC = \mathrm{Hom}\_\mathbb{C}(-,C)\colon \mathbb{C}^{\mathrm{op}} \rightarrow \mathbf{Sets} \\]
and taking $f\colon C\rightarrow D$ to the natural transformation
\\[ yf = \mathrm{hom}\_\mathbb{C}(-,f)\colon \mathrm{Hom}\_\mathbb{C}(-,C)\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}\_\mathbb{C}(-,D), \\]
... One should thus think of the Yoneda embedding $y$ as a "representation" of $\mathbb{C}$ in a category of set-valued functors and natural transformations.... (Category Theory, p.&nbsp;187)

Now things become obvious. The category $\mathcal{C}$ in the definition of the Yoneda lemma is just $\mathbf{Mat}$ in Emily's example, and the hom-set $Hom(yC, F)$ is just the desired set of natural transformations (i.e., column operations) in Emily's question. This means that $yC$ is the given $k$-column functor and $F$ is the other random $j$-column functor. Since $y$ is the Yoneda embedding functor, which sends a $\mathcal{C}$-object $C$ to the representable functor $Hom_\mathcal{C}(-,C)$, we can suitably identify $C$ with $k$ in the category $\mathbf{Mat}$---because $Hom_\mathcal{C}(-,C)$ looks like $Hom_\mathbf{Mat}(-,k)\equiv-\times k$.

So, now we have substituted both $F$ and $C$ in the definition of the Yoneda lemma with variables in Emily's example. The Yoneda lemma says the desired set of natural transformations is determined by $FC$, which is just $-\times j(k)\equiv k\times j$ in the matrix example. This is exactly the "single matrix" mentioned in Emily's solution (Step 1). As to the peculiar-looking column operation application $\alpha_k(I_k)$ in Step 2, it doesn't show up in the definition of the Yoneda lemma but corresponds to a particular function in the detailed calculation (see my [Category Theory Notes 16](https://blog.juliosong.com/linguistics/mathematics/category-theory-notes-16/)). But I think the real key step in our understanding is Step 1. Once we get the correspondence between it and the definition of the Yoneda lemma, we get how the lemma is used in this matrix example.
