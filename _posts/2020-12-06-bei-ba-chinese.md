**This post was originally published on CamLangSci in July 2016. I repost it here (with some reformatting and slight modification) because CamLangSci seems to be down.**

The languages we speak are never short of little surprises that constantly remind us of the complexity and flexibility of our mind. For instance, the other day I was rewatching an old episode (originally aired in 2005) of one of my favorite TV shows, [*100% Entertainment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100%25_Entertainment) (娛樂百分百), and heard one of the hostesses [Barbie Hsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbie_Hsu) saying:

(1) ⋯⋯還**被**媒體**把**你罵得狗血淋頭。(Mandarin)<br>
<i>... hái <b>bèi</b> méitǐ <b>bǎ</b> nǐ mà de gǒuxiělíntóu.</i> <br>
... also BEI media BA you scold like dog-blood-poured-on-head<br>
"...and you also get harshly criticized by the media."

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/yubai-screenshot.png" alt="a screenshot from 100% Entertainment" caption="A screenshot from the Taiwanese TV show *100% Entertainment* (source: [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com))" %}

The sentence sounds alright, except that it includes both *bèi* 被 and *bǎ* 把. What’s wrong with that? Well, in Mandarin Chinese *bèi* is used in passive sentences to introduce the active subject, and *bǎ* functions like a transitive/accusative marker on the object. Their uses are illustrated below (PFV = Perfective, ACC = Accusative):



(2)	a.	狗狗喫了蘋果。(active)<br>
*gǒugou	chī-le		píngguǒ.*<br>
		puppy		eat-PFV	apple<br>
		<span class="vspace">"The puppy ate apple(s)."</span><br>
	b.	蘋果**被**狗狗喫了。(passive)<br>
  <i>píngguǒ	<b>bèi</b>		gǒugou		chī-le.</i><br>
		apple		BEI		puppy		eat-PFV <br>
		<span class="vspace">"The apple(s) was eaten by the puppy."</span><br>
	c.	狗狗**把**蘋果喫了。(active, with fronted direct object)<br>
  <i>gǒugou	<b>bǎ</b>		píngguǒ	chī-le.</i><br>
		puppy		BA		apple		eat-PFV<br>
		"The puppy ate the apple(s)."

(2a) is the neutral way to report this event, where the subject is "the puppy" and the object is "apple(s)." In (2b), "apple(s)"" becomes the syntactic subject, while "the puppy" is introduced by *bèi* (similar to English *by*), thus rendering a "passive" sentence. In (2c), the subject is again "the puppy," but the object "apple(s)" takes *bǎ*, which explicitly clarifies it as the affected patient of "eat" and entails an agent subject (the eater in this case). That is, when the object is introduced by *bǎ*, the verb is unambiguously transitive and active.

**Dec 7, 2020 edit:** At this point one may be tempted to treat *bèi* and *bǎ* as prepositions, and they have indeed been treated so by linguists. However, a major point of this post will be that these functional words in Chinese don't really behave like bona fide prepositions in familiar European languages. Rather, they form a grammatical category that lies somewhere between Verb and Preposition.

So, taking these into consideration, Barbie Hsu’s sentence in (1) is literally something like:

(3)	"... and also by the media harshly criticizes you."

As you can see, it doesn’t work in English. But why is it okay in Chinese? Before I answer this question, let's look at some similar examples first, which all suggest that the coexistence of *bèi* and *bǎ* is not only okay in Mandarin but also productive.

(4)	a. 小羊**被**老虎**把**頭咬下來了。<br>
<i>xiǎo-yáng	<b>bei</b>		lǎohǔ	<b>bǎ</b>	tóu		yǎo-xiàlái-le.</i><br>
		little-sheep	BEI		tiger	BA	head	bite-down-PFV<br>
		<span class="vspace">"The lamb got its head bitten off by the tiger."</span><br>
	b. 斐雯**被**老師**把**漫畫書沒收了。<br>
  	<i>fēiwén	<b>bèi</b>		lǎoshī	<b>ba</b>	mànhuà-shū	mòshōu-le.</i><br>
		Feiwen	BEI		teacher	BA	comic-book		confiscate-PFV<br>
		<span class="vspace">"Feiwen had her comic book confiscated by the teacher."</span><br>
	c.	臉臉**被**小刀**把**手割破了。<br>
  <i>liǎnlian		<b>bèi</b>	xiǎo-dāo	<b>bǎ</b>	shǒu	gē-pò-le.<br>
		Lianlian		BEI	small-knife	BA	hand	cut-broken-PFV<br>
		"Lianlian got her hand cut by the small knife."

This pattern is reminiscent of a construction in Japanese called "[suffering passive](https://sites.google.com/site/jpnkyo/grammar/particles/niadvanced/sufferingpassive)," as in (5) (TOP = Topic, PASS = Passive, PST = Past, GEN = Genitive).

(5)	a.	私は妹**に**時計**を**壊**され**た。(Japanese)<br>
<i>watashi-wa	imooto-<b>ni</b>			tokee-<b>o</b>		kowas-<b>are</b>-ta.</i><br>
		I-TOP		younger sister-by		watch-ACC	break-PASS-PST<br>
		<span class="vspace">"I got my watch broken by my younger sister."</span><br>
	b.	私は隣の人**に**足**を**踏**まれ**た。<br>
  <i>watashi-wa	tonari-no	hito-<b>ni</b>		ashi-<b>o</b>		hum-<b>are</b>-ta.</i><br>
		I-TOP		next-GEN	person-by	foot-ACC	step-PASS-PST<br>
		"I got my foot stepped on by the person standing next to me."

Again we see the coexistence of an oblique (i.e., nonsubject) agent and an accusative patient. Furthermore, in Japanese the passive voice is morphologically marked (*-are-*). Note that "I" in (5a/b) is not a subject but the discourse topic. Intuitively this also seems to be true for the Chinese sentences in (4), whose English translations more accurately should be:

(6)	a.	"As for the lamb, BEI the tiger bit off its head."<br>
	b.	"As for Feiwen, BEI the teacher confiscated her comic book."<br>
	c.	"As for Lianlian, BEI the small knife cut her hand."

I have let BEI stay as such, because despite the similarity, it is not an exact counterpart of English *by* (as used in passive constructions). The quasi-passive function word *bèi* 被 historically derived from a verb meaning "to cover" or "to suffer"---and those literal meanings are still reflected in some words and phrases today, as in (7).

(7)	a.	**被**災/難<br>
<i><b>bèi</b>-zāi/nàn</i><br>
 <span class="vspace">"suffer from disasters"</span><br>
	b.	澤**被**天下/萬世<br>
  <i>zé <b>bèi</b> tiān xià / wàn shì</i><br>
   "benefits cover all over the world / many generations"

Apart from the verbal meaning, *bèi* also has a nominal meaning "cover," which is well preserved today, as in *bèizi* 'quilt', *mián-bèi* 'cotton quilt', etc.

Of course, in the "passive" construction *bèi* no longer keeps its original literal meanings. But it is plausible that it still retains some verbal property. In other words, what matters here for *bèi* is not the literal meaning but the **syntactic category**. Belonging to the verbal category, *bèi* can still join the verbal predicate quite freely and does not have to do this as a complement or adjunct (as the English *by*-phrase does).

In fact, the patient introducing *bǎ* has a similar status in Chinese. It had also originated as a [content word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_word) in history---a verb meaning "to hold by hand"---and has developed the usage as a bleached verbal category. Actually the verbal use of *bǎ* today is even clearer than that of *bèi*, as in (8).

(8)	**Some Mandarin words/phrases with *bǎ* used as a verb:**<br>
<span class="vspace">a. V-O constructions: 把酒 *bǎ jiǔ* 'hold the alcohol', 把門 *bǎ mén* 'hold the door', 把權 *bǎ quán* 'hold the power'</span><br>
b. V-V compounds: 把持 *bǎ-chí* 'hold and	keep, be in control', 把守 *bǎ-shǒu* 'hold and guard, guard', 把玩 *bǎ-wán* 'hold and play with'

Elements like *bèi* and *bǎ* are sometimes called [**light verbs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_verb), since they are light in meaning (due to the bleaching of their original literal meanings) but still belong to the verbal category and perform some verbal functions. Here are some common English expressions with light verbs (boldface): <i><b>do</b> the cleaning</i>, <i><b>have</b> a nap</i>, <i><b>give</b> a talk</i>, <i><b>take</b> a shower</i>, etc.

We can treat *bèi* as a light verb that introduces the agent or instrument argument and *bǎ* as one that introduces the patient argument into the predicate. They can coexist in Chinese simply because they both exist in the language, as in (9a).

(9)	a. Chinese:	<br>
<i>hai		<b>bei</b>-meiti		<b>ba</b>-ni			ma de gouxuelintou.</i><br>
					<span class="vspace">and		AGENT-media	PATIENT-you	scold harshly</span><br>
	b. English:	You<sub>PATIENT</sub> also get harshly criticized by the media<sub>AGENT</sub>.

By comparison, since English does not have argument-introducing light verbs like *bèi* and *bǎ*, when the verb is inflected in passive, the original object (*you*) must be licensed otherwise. In this case it becomes the "subject," and the original subject (*the media*) subsequently gets licensed in the prepositional *by*-phrase, as in (9b). In sum, we can say that *bèi* and *by* have similar semantic functions but distinct syntactic categories, and that Chinese does not really have the English type passive construction.

Now you may wonder where the subject (or more exactly the [topic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_and_comment)) is in (10a). Well, it is simply omitted because its information is clear in the context. When you are scolded, the default topic is clearly you! Indeed, (10a) can be recovered as (11), which is exactly what Barbie Hsu means.

(11)	你還被媒體把你罵得狗血淋頭。<br>
<i>ni<sub>TOPIC</sub>	hai	bei-meiti	ba-ni	ma de gouxuelintou.</i><br>
	you<sub>TOPIC</sub>		also	AGENT-media	PATIENT-you	scold harshly<br>

How come Chinese systematically uses topic as a part of the sentence whereas English does not is a whole other story. A relevant fact is that if we omit the topic elements in the Japanese examples in (5), the sentences are also still well-formed, as in (12).

(12)	a. 妹に時計を壊された。<br>	*Imooto-ni tokee-o kowas-are-ta.*<br> <span class="vspace">"(My) watch was broken by (my) younger sister."</span><br>
	b.	隣の人に足を踏まれた。<br>*Tonari-no hito-ni ashi-o hum-are-ta.*<br> "(My) foot got stepped on by the next person."

Of course, *bèi* and *bǎ* are not the only two light verbs in Chinese; there are still many more, such as *yòng* 用 (introducing an instrument), *gěi* 給 (a casual alternative of *bèi*), *jiāng* 將 (a formal alternative of *bǎ*), etc. Maybe if you join me to watch TV together, you will notice Barbie Hsu and her sister [Dee Hsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dee_Hsu) frequently use other light verbs as well. Language is our most faithful companion, and we can surely find out many marvelous facts about it if we pay a bit more attention and... study some Syntax!
