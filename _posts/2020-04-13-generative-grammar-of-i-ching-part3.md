In the [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-04-10-generative-grammar-of-i-ching-part2 %}) I introduced the structural components of _I Ching_ divination, including lines (or monograms), trigrams, and hexagrams. In this and the next post I'll write about how those components are interpreted. Two posts are dedicated to this topic because result interpretation is the most complex part of _I Ching_ divination. Impatient readers can jump to the [summary]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-04-17-generative-grammar-of-i-ching-part4 %}#summary).

## Hexagram level
Interpretation of _I Ching_ divination results traditionally starts from the hexagram level. This is also the easiest level for beginners, because one simply needs to look up a hexagram in the book and read it. For example, the two hexagrams in the [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-04-10-generative-grammar-of-i-ching-part2 %}#weichi) are respectively called _wei chi_ 'before completion' (<span class="hanyu">Êú™Êøü</span> ‰∑ø) and _sun_ 'decrease' (<span class="hanyu">Êêç</span> ‰∑®).<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> The status quo of the questioner's concern is in "before completion" and its future development is in "decrease."

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/baynes-i-ching-contents.png" alt="two screenshots from the contents of the I Ching" caption="screenshots from the contents of the _I Ching_ (source: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ching-Book-Changes-Bollingen-General-ebook/dp/B004S6QSYO/ref=pd_sbsd_14_1/131-5037760-1292952?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B004S6QSYO&pd_rd_r=04713b3f-aba4-42fb-96c0-335c71fafe79&pd_rd_w=4cQqO&pd_rd_wg=mEjPA&pf_rd_p=2c2d0d3b-b3c5-4110-93fa-2c1270309ac1&pf_rd_r=39323P1W74XP3940AYQD&psc=1&refRID=39323P1W74XP3940AYQD))" %}

Reading through the respective chapters in the _I Ching_ (i.e., Chapter 64 and Chapter 41), we find the following judgments:<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
>[wei chi](https://www.iching-online.com/hexagrams/iching-hexagram-101010.html): Before completion. Success. But if the little fox, after nearly completing the crossing, gets his tail in the water, there is nothing that would further.

>[sun](https://www.iching-online.com/hexagrams/iching-hexagram-100011.html): Decrease combined with sincerity brings about supreme good fortune without blame. One may be persevering in this. It furthers one to undertake something. How is this to be carried out? One may use two small bowls for the sacrifice.

As we can see, the judgments are quite abstruse and filled with metaphors. This is not a translation issue, as the original Chinese texts are equally (if not more) abstruse. That's why ancient Confucian scholars insisted that the book be read together with their commentaries, which they named the Ten Wings (<span class="hanyu">ÂçÅÁøº</span>)---without which readers of the _I Ching_ could not "fly" high.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/ten-wings.png" alt="a visualization of the ten wings" caption="a visualization of the Ten Wings for _I Ching_ (adapted from [new.qq.com](https://new.qq.com/omn/20191121/20191121A0MO4O00.html))" %}

Abstruse as they are, the central messages in the two judgments are clear enough. Neither the present nor the future situation of the questioner's concern is perfectly auspicious, though both are still largely positive. According to Wilhelm/Baynes, _wei chi_ advises the questioner to take extra deliberation and caution for the time being, and _sun_ advises him to draw on inner strength to compensate for what he lacks on the outside in the future. (Just to clarify, I didn't sort yarrow stalks or throw coins to get the example hexagrams, nor did I ask any question, so this "result" is purely expository.)

## Trigram level
A hexagram is made up of two trigrams, and hexagram names are often referenced jointly with their constituent trigrams' names---or more exactly with the trigrams' names in their [archetypal category]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-04-10-generative-grammar-of-i-ching-part2 %}#arche)---such as "fire-water _wei chi_" (<span class="hanyu">ÁÅ´Ê∞¥Êú™Êøü</span> ‚ò≤‚òµ‰∑ø) and "mountain-lake _sun_" (<span class="hanyu">Â±±Êæ§Êêç</span> ‚ò∂‚ò±‰∑®), meaning that the archetypal image of _wei chi_ is fire-over-water and that of _sun_ is mountain-over-lake.

**The interpretation of a trigram is determined by two factors: its intrinsic meaning and its position in the ambient hexagram.** The latter is easier to elucidate, so I'll begin with it.

(NB: The trigrams discussed here are all _primary trigrams_. In this introductory text I abstract away from the widely used yet controversial [_nuclear trigrams_](https://www.onlineclarity.co.uk/answers/2006/10/05/nuclear-hexagrams-why-bother/). Check [this page](http://enews.open2u.com.tw/~noupd/book_up/1589/8007.htm) for the controversy if you can read Chinese.)

### Slot meaning
The two trigram slots in a hexagram have their "slot meanings" independent of the specific trigrams inserted there. The most obvious slot meaning is the basic configuration that the upper trigram is above the lower trigram. This is often interpreted in combination with the momentum (i.e., upward or downward movement) of the archetypal elements denoted by the trigrams.

For example, in the hexagram ‰∑ã (_p'i_ 'standstill' <span class="hanyu">Âê¶</span>) the heaven (‚ò∞) is above the earth (‚ò∑). Albeit natural, this isn't a good thing in the _I Ching_ system, because it means the heaven's energy (which goes upward) and the earth's energy (which goes downward) are moving away from each other, depriving the world of creativity and leaving it in stagnation.

There's another, more abstract way to view the two trigram slots, in which the upper trigram is called the _outer trigram_ and the lower trigram is called the _inner trigram_. The inner trigram represents the essence, foundation, or internal conditions of a situation, while the outer trigram represents the environment the situation is embedded in or its external conditions.

For example, the hexagram ‰∑Ñ (_hs√º_ 'waiting' <span class="hanyu">ÈúÄ</span>) has water (‚òµ) on the outside and heaven (‚ò∞) on the inside. This means the questioner is internally strong but externally stuck in a difficult environment, so the best thing for him to do is wait, as the name of the hexagram suggests.

<a id="intrinsic"></a>
### Intrinsic meaning
Compared to their slot meanings, the trigrams' intrinsic meanings are a lot more difficult to pin down---so difficult that people often just give out a list of specialized meanings when asked. For example:
>‚ò∞ ch'ien (<span class="hanyu">‰πæ</span>): heaven; creativity; father; horse; head...<br>
>‚ò± tui (<span class="hanyu">ÂÖå</span>): lake; openness; third daughter; sheep; mouth...<br>
>‚ò∂ k√™n (<span class="hanyu">ËâÆ</span>): mountain; standstill; youngest son; dog; hand...<br>
><span style="text-align: right; display: block;"> --- summarized from [Discussion of the Trigrams](https://shapeless.org/chou_i/shou_kua.html)</span>

_Discussion of the Trigrams_ (i.e., the Confucian Eighth Wing) deals with the various concepts the eight trigrams can represent in multitudinous categories (nature, animal, family, etc.). Certain trigram concepts share a core meaning; for instance, heaven, creativity, and father all have creative power in Chinese philosophy. But apparently this core meaning interpretation isn't universally applicable. For example, it's unclear what the conceptual correlation between lake and third daughter is. In fact the meaning "third daughter" is derived based on a particular way to perceive the trigram---the male (‚ò∞) seeks the power of the female (‚öã) and receives a daughter at the third time (‚ò±).üòù By analogy, ‚ò¥ (_sun_ 'the Gentle' <span class="hanyu">Â∑Ω</span>) can mean the eldest daughter and ‚ò≤ (_li_ 'the Clinging' <span class="hanyu">Èõ¢</span>) can mean the middle daughter.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/three-daughters.png" alt="the relationship between father and three daughters in I Ching" caption="The _I Ching_ views daughters as the result of the father seeking female power." %}

So, if there is any across-the-board rule governing the intrinsic meanings of trigrams at all, it is probably the "boring" fact that **each trigram symbol, when combined with a category, produces a more or less idiosyncratic concept.** I will come back to this point in [Part 6]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-04-23-generative-grammar-of-i-ching-part6 %})).

The above rule in itself doesn't sound very helpful, because we still need to learn the numerous concepts associated with each trigram one by one. But the good news is that in the actual usage of the trigrams, at least when they are used for divination purposes,<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> we seldom need to consider the trigrams' specialized meanings. Most of the time knowing their archetypal meanings is enough, such as heaven and its creativity, lake and its openness, and so on.

Back to our initial example, the two component trigrams in _wei chi_ (‰∑ø) are _li_ 'the Clinging' (<span class="hanyu">Èõ¢</span> ‚ò≤) and _k'an_ 'the Abysmal' (<span class="hanyu">Âùé</span> ‚òµ), which respectively stand for fire and water in their archetypal category. Since fire and water move in different directions in nature, in this configuration they are doomed to part company, hence the following interpretation:
>Fire flares upward, water flows downward; hence there is no completion. If one were to attempt to force completion, harm would result. Therefore one must separate things in order to unite them.
