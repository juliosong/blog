## Monogram level
Finally, in the interpretation of divination results we must sometimes take certain monograms (i.e., individual lines) into account as well. The most important monograms are the changing lines (sometimes translated as "moving lines"), so I'll start with them.

### Changing lines
Recall that the _Classic of Changes_ is all about changes. Therefore, the changing lines in a present hexagram, if any, are of special importance, for they are what give rise to the future hexagram---or in less mystical terms, what connect two particular hexagrams out of the total sixty-four.

Since which line(s) are moving is dictated by chance, the result of _I Ching_ divination is highly personalized (there are altogether 64×64=4096 present/future hexagram combinations!). That's what distinguishes _I Ching_ divination from other types of symbolomancy divination such as tarot cards.
>No other symbolomancy method ... has separate meanings for each component of a card's picture. The card/symbol is what it is. ... This is the great asset of the I Ching. Its inherent flexibility allows for "tailoring" the specific message to you.<br>

The changing lines or <i>biangua</i> are another <i>I Ching</i> concept that has been fossilized into the Chinese language, which means "to change one's mind" or "to go back on one's word" in daily speech.<br>

<ul>
<li><i>Nǐ biànguà yě tài kuài le.</i><br>
(<span class="hanyu">你變卦也太快了。</span>)<br>
"You change your mind too fast."</li>
</ul>
</div>

The _I Ching_ has a dedicated section for changing lines in each chapter. The two changing lines in _wei chi_ are the first and the fourth line from bottom up. They hold the following messages for the questioner:
>Line 1 (⚋ → ⚊): He gets his tail in the water. Humiliating.
>Line 4 (⚊ → ⚋): Perseverance brings good fortune. Remorse disappears. Shock, thus to discipline the Devil's Country. For three years, great realms are awarded.

Again the statements are abstruse but the gists are clear. They basically say that there are two crucial factors in the development from _wei chi_ to _sun_: haste in times of disorder and perseverance in times of struggle. And the questioner should pay extra attention to these factors.

Now, does that mean the present situation won't change if the questioner deliberately ignores these factors? I'm not in a position to give a definite answer. The truth is, result interpretation has been the most difficult part of _I Ching_ divination for millennia, even for professional soothsayers. **When interpreting divination results, all layers of meaning must be taken into account, perhaps with different weights.** There's actually much controversy on this; see [this page](http://www.russellcottrell.com/VirtualYarrowStalks/rules.htm) for a comparative introduction.

Following Wilhelm's interpretation rules, which takes into account both the present and the future hexagrams as well as all the changing lines, I guess the two factors above are only crucial in the sense that they are aspects where the questioner's action can make a (limited) difference but not in the sense that the whole timeline hinges on them. In other words, "fate" only cares about the overall direction of a change but not about the bumps and bruises en route.

### Line slots
Just as the upper/lower trigram slots have their predetermined meanings, so each of the six line slots in the hexagram has some fixed interpretation independent of the type of line we insert there. First, the six line slots are "gendered," with the odd-number slots (from bottom up) being yang (aka masculine) and the even-number slots being yin (aka feminine).

<a id="qualit"></a>Second, four out of the six line slots of the hexagram come with some configurational good/bad attribution, with the fifth slot from bottom up being the best position in a hexagram. The second slot is also meritorious. The middle (i.e., third and fourth) slots, on the other hand, are deemed dangerous and disquieting. The bottom/top slots don't have a good/bad attribute for _I Ching_-internal reasons.
>The beginning line is difficult to understand. The top line is easy to understand. The second [line] is usually praised, the fourth is usually warned. The third [line] usually has misfortune, the fifth usually has merit.<br>
>(<span class="hanyu">初難知，上易知。二多譽，四多惧。三多凶，五多功。</span>)<br>
><span style="text-align: right; display: block;"> --- The Great Commentary (Part II), Chapter IX</span>

<a id="agree"></a>Based on the above two types of line slot meaning, the most auspicious lines in _I Ching_ are those that occupy the fifth or the second slot and agree with those slots in gender; namely, a yang line at the fifth slot or a yin line at the second slot---and a hexagram with both is just wonderful.👑

<a id="crossline"></a>
### Cross-line relationships
In historical commentaries of the _I Ching_ we can often see various cross-line relationships; for example, in the figure above the second and the fifth lines are said to be "central and correct." Relationships like this are supposed to help readers evaluate how auspicious a hexagram is, though in my opinion they aren't that important for amateurs because one can get exactly the same information from the line statements. I think cross-line relationships are more of a theoretician's toy, since they can help explain why certain line statements are written that way.

But anyway, I'm listing a few major cross-line relationships here because they represent a different kind of symbolic operation in the _I Ching_ system---**besides stacking one symbol one on another, we can also link remote symbols together.** So, in a hexagram,
- any number of yin lines below any number of yang lines are said to _support_ (<span class="hanyu">承</span>) the yang lines, which is good;
- any number of yin lines above a single yang line are said to _ride_ (<span class="hanyu">乘</span>) the yang line, which is bad;
- each line and the line two slots away from it (e.g., first and fourth, second and fifth) are said to be in _correspondence_ (<span class="hanyu">應</span>), which is only good when the two lines are opposite in gender;
- whatever is in the fifth/second slot is said to be _central_ (<span class="hanyu">中</span>), because these are the middle slots in the upper/lower trigrams;
- <a id="correctly"></a>a yang line at the fifth slot or a yin line at the second slot is said to be _central and correct_ (<span class="hanyu">中正</span>) because its gender matches that of its slot---this is a highly auspicious configuration;
- <a id="perfectly"></a>if the fifth line is yang **and** the second line is yin, then they are simultaneously central, correct, and in correspondence (aka "perfectly central" <span class="hanyu">大中</span>)---this is a best configuration.

At this point I'm reminded of a historical aside: Former ROC President [Chiang Kai-Shek](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/蔣中正#稱呼名字)'s name and his [courtesy name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courtesy_name) (Chung-Cheng) are both taken from the _I Ching_. They both come from the interpretation of the second line in the hexagram ䷏ ([_yü_](https://www.iching-online.com/hexagrams/iching-hexagram-001000.html) 'enthusiasm' <span class='hanyu'>豫</span>). Kai-Shek (<span class='hanyu'>介石</span>) means "firm as a rock" and Chung-Cheng (<span class='hanyu'>中正</span>) means "central and correct."
>**Firm as a rock.** Not a whole day. Perseverance brings good fortune.<br>
>(<span class="hanyu">介於石，不終日，貞吉。</span>)<br>
>"Not a whole day. Perseverance brings good fortune," because it is **central and correct**.<br>
>(<span class="hanyu">不終日，貞吉，以中正也。</span>)<br>
><span style="text-align: right; display: block;"> --- statement and commentary of line 2 in Yü</span>

This line is highly auspicious, though unfortunately the entire hexagram isn't as auspicious. Also, Chiang isn't alone in his enthusiasm for the _I Ching_; most of those who ever ruled China in the past two millennia, either completely or partially, had been big fans of the book. Its status in traditional Chinese culture is similar to the status of the Bible in the West. Incidentally, the Chinese name for the Bible is _Sheng Ching_ 'the Holy Classic' (<span class="hanyu">聖經</span>).

## Summary
The result of an _I Ching_ divination session consists of two parts: a hexagram and some (zero or more) changing lines. The hexagram contains information about the status quo of the question being asked, and the changing lines---together with the new hexagram after the changes have been implemented---contain information about its future development.

Practically, to get the interpretation of a divination result all one needs to do is look up the hexagram in the book and read through its chapter. But there's more to _I Ching_ interpretation than that. An important question that had puzzled distinguished scholars throughout Chinese history is, **Why are the statements for hexagrams written the way they are?**

Since the compilation time of the _I Ching_ was way too back in history even for Confucius, those who studied the book could only follow its text either semireligiously or with some extra theorization. And here's where the multiple interpretative levels I've introduced in this and the last post became relevant---the various structural components and their meanings enabled scholars to formulate theories about the original _I Ching_ text, thus giving rise to "[more than two and a half millennia's worth of commentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching)."

In sum, the overall meaning of a hexagram can be deduced from the meanings of its constituent trigrams. And when those alone aren't explanatory enough---they certainly aren't if one wants to provide explanations for the changing lines' meanings as well---there are still other tools that can help, such as the "nuclear trigrams," the "slot meanings," and the cross-line relationships. Note that none of these extra components are actually mentioned in the original _I Ching_ text. They're just supplementary postulates made by ancient scholars (aka commentators) in their endeavor to answer the boldfaced question above.

The original _I Ching_ text has two major components: a list of complex symbols and a record of their final interpretations. The mapping between the two is simply given, without any explanation of how it had been arrived at. This state of affairs is fairly reminiscent of that with human language. Each language is essentially also just a mapping between complex symbols and their interpretations. And a linguistician's goal is to figure out the details of the mapping as reasonably as possible, just like an _I Ching_ scholar's goal as described above. The only difference here is that the symbols in human languages are naturally evolved whereas those in the _I Ching_ are human-designed. That kind of makes the _I Ching_ symbolic system an "artificial language"---and probably an earliest one in human history.

I'll enumerate the similarities between _I Ching_ theorization and linguistic theorization that I've thought of in the [next]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2020-04-20-generative-grammar-of-i-ching-part5 %}) two posts.
