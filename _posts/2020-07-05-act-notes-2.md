In this second lecture by [Fabrizio Genovese](https://statebox.org/team/fabrizio/), we are taught the basics of string diagrams and especially their uses in monoidal categories. Fabrizio pointed out right at the beginning that string diagrams represent a sort of graphical reasoning, which as a general idea and practice dates back to ancient history (though it kind of fell out of fashion for a while). Then he gave the following one-line summary of the subject---before he turned the camera to a piece of paper and began to hand-draw string diagrams.

> String diagrams are like a jungle. There are multiple flavors of them. (FG)

String diagrams differ from the ordinary diagrams we typically see in category theory textbooks in that the graphical symbols for objects and morphisms are sort of swapped. While objects are zero-dimensional dots or points and morphisms are one-dimensional lines in ordinary diagrams, they become (respectively) lines and points in string diagrams. For example:

![a simple diagram](/assets/images/act2020-l2-01.png){:width="30%"}

becomes

![a simple string diagram](/assets/images/act2020-l2-02.png){:width="30%"}

This is essentially a switch of perspective, and we can define syntactic sugars with it. For instance, identity morphisms, which do nothing, can just be omitted in string diagrams---or conceived as invisible, implicit boxes. So

![a simple diagram with id](/assets/images/act2020-l2-03.png){:width="30%"}

becomes

![a simple string diagram with id](/assets/images/act2020-l2-04.png){:width="30%"}

Fabrizio emphasized that it didn't matter where to put the boxes in string diagrams as long as connectivity was preserved. So the following three string diagrams are all the same:

> The only thing that matters is what is connected to what. (FG)

Fabrizio also pointed out that different people might prefer reading and drawing string diagrams in different directions:
- the canonical direction in category theory and categorical physics is from bottom up;
- the conventional direction in categorical linguistics is from top down;
- the way Fabrizio draws them in this lecture is from left to right.

> Currently the only way no one draws string diagrams in is from right to left... (FG)

Next, Fabrizio went on to introduce how composition is done in string diagrams. For example, the normally presented composition

![composition](/assets/images/act2020-l2-06.png){:width="30%"}

becomes

![composition in string diagram](/assets/images/act2020-l2-07.png){:width="30%"}

which, in Fabrizio's words, gives a nice process-oriented presentation of composition---just like the input/output on circuit boards. And this point Fabrizio once again reminded us that what matters was the connectivity rather than the particular shape of the string/wire, with the following real-life metaphor:

> When you connect your toaster to the socket it doesn't matter whether you bend the wire; all that matters is that the wire is connected. (FG)

After illustrating how string diagrams work in basic categories, Fabrizio entered the main section of his lecture; namely, the application of string diagrams in higher categories, in particular 2-categories. Simply put, 2-categories are categories that have morphisms between morphisms. And the string-diagram solution to their representation is an intuitive extension of that of 1-categories:
1. draw objects as two-dimensional surfaces,
2. draw morphisms as one-dimensional lines serving as boundaries of adjacent surfaces, and
3. draw morphisms between morphisms as zero-dimensional dots on the surface boundary lines.

In particular, step 3 suggests that each surface boundary line may accommodate multiple morphisms, and the order to read them is from bottom up. For example, the following normally drawn 2-category

![normal 2-category](/assets/images/act2020-l2-08.png){:width="30%"}

becomes

![string diagram 2-category](/assets/images/act2020-l2-09.png){:width="30%"}

which looks quite different but luckily isn't hard to understand.

Just like identity morphisms in 1-categories, identity morphisms in 2-categories are simply left out in string diagrams---or we could conceive them as invisible boundaries/dots.

![string diagram 2-category id](/assets/images/act2020-l2-11.png){:width="80%"}

And composition in 2-categories is also pretty straightforward.

![string diagram 2-category composition](/assets/images/act2020-l2-12.png){:width="45%"}

Moreover, morphisms between morphisms can be composed either vertically or horizontally. For example, in the following string diagram

![string diagram 2-category 2-cell composition](/assets/images/act2020-l2-14.png){:width="50%"}

the four 2-morphisms can be composed either first vertically or first horizontally. The result would be the same (as in natural transformation composition in 1-categories).

After giving out the above examples, Fabrizio mentioned that we could further lift the categorical dimension and talk about $n$-categories, which have morphisms between morphisms between ... between morphisms (up to $n$). And string diagrams can also conveniently handle those higher categories, though when $n\gt 4$ things become hard to visualize. In 3-categories, for instance, an object in string diagram would be a space, a 1-morphism would be a boundary surface between adjacent spaces, a 2-morphism would be an edge line on one of the boundary surfaces, and a 3-morphism would be a dot on a boundary surface edge line.

The most important kind of categories out there for string diagrams to represent are the monoidal categories. A monoidal category is a 2-category with one object. In such a category we can perform parallel composition (via the "tensor product" operation $\otimes$) in addition to normal composition. And since a monoidal category has only one object, there's no need to explicitly draw out any (delimited) surface. For example, in the following string diagram

![string diagram 2-category tensor product](/assets/images/act2020-l2-15.png){:width="50%"}

apart from the normal composition $g\circ f$ we also have the parallel composition (in non-string-diagram format)

![string diagram 2-category tensor composition](/assets/images/act2020-l2-16.png){:width="45%"}

Here the tensor product symbol $\otimes$ highlights that this is not necessarily categorical product and also generalizes the tensor product of vector spaces, as Paolo Perrone explained in the Zoom chat. Two other audience members also mentioned something about tensor categories:
- A tensor category is often used to mean a monoidal category with some particular extra structures. (Joe Moeller)
- A tensor category is usually assumed to be symmetric monoidal. (Andrei Konovalov)

In the last part of the lecture, Fabrizio introduced a few new string-diagrammatic operations, such as "knots," "traces," and "snakes." His point was that when you come up with a new notion or flavor of category, there may or may not be a string diagram for it, and the only way to find out whether there is one is via making up a graphical calculus for it by yourself.
