Welcome to my blog! I am Julio Song, a final-year PhD student in theoretical linguistics at University of Cambridge. My main research area is syntax.

I regularly post short nonacademic articles here about languages and linguistics, including fun facts about world languages, introductions of components in my research, language learning notes, and so on. I occasionally also post nonlinguistic stuff about my life, such as books I read and movies I watch. You are welcome to suggest new topics to me too (check out my suggestion page).

Modern linguistics is a subject that lies at the crossroads of humanities and natural sciences. I am especially fascinated by the diverse grammatical rules and patterns employed by natural languages, which I believe are a window into the complexity and intricacy of the human mind. For my academic publications please visit my [home page](https://juliosong.github.io).

I have named my blog I-Yuwen because _yu3wen2_ (èªžæ–‡) means "languages and scripts" in Mandarin Chinese, so I-Yuwen well reflects the theme of this blog: my personal stories with languages. Incidentally, the name also rhymes with the phrase _ai4yu3wen2_ (æ„›èªžæ–‡), which means "love languages and scripts." Hope you will love languages more after reading my blog!ðŸ˜ƒ
