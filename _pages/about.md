Welcome to my blog! I regularly post nonacademic articles here about language and linguistics, including fun facts about world languages, introductions of components in my research, language learning notes, and so on. I occasionally also post nonlinguistic stuff about my life, such as books I read and movies I watch. You are welcome to suggest new topics to me too (check out my [suggestion](../suggestion) page).

Modern linguistics is a subject that lies at the crossroads of humanities and natural sciences. I am especially fascinated by the diverse grammatical rules and patterns employed by natural languages, which I believe are a window into the complexity and intricacy of the human mind. For my academic publications please visit my [home page](https://www.juliosong.com).

I have named my blog I-Yuwen because _yu3wen2_ (<span class="hanyu">èªžæ–‡</span>) means "language and script" in Mandarin Chinese, so I-Yuwen well reflects the theme of this blog: my personal stories with language and script. Incidentally, the name is also homophonous with the Mandarin phrase _ai4yu3wen2_ (<span class="hanyu">æ„›èªžæ–‡</span>), which means "love language and script." Hope you will love them more after reading my blog!ðŸ˜ƒ
